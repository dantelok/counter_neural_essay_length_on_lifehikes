So holiday PTO or vacation time and everyone wants to travel, right travelling? It's the most important thing and therefore I have one question to the audience. I want to know from you where you travel, travel, you're outside the country usually or you stay in the country. So if you are staying. In the country, then do nothing, and if you go outside the country then lift your arm. Pretty easy, yeah. So usually you are traveling outside the country, so there's a really good quote from. Um, let me see what you want, Wolfgang from Kuta, he said analogously translated as a part of a poem who is usually trip. Who is usually traveling for vacation? No, that's not the right thing. So see I missed something here, so sorry for that. Do you want to wander further and further see the good is close to you. So this means why you are not thinking about it staying in your home region in your home country, because everything what you need is outside your home. It's in your region is in your maybe also in your town, so there is no need to go to them to see, because most probably you have also in your own country a seaside where you can lie on the beach and the right time of the year, right? So if the sun is shining and such things and you have a really great countryside. So it's different, so I have only to leave your home and travel only ten 2050 kilometers, and then you have great cities around you. Old cities like Bamberg or to bring in. Or you go to the castles around you so we have many many castles here in Germany. Really nice places to be visited and it's really fantastic to see the old architecture.

"Hi everyone, today's meeting goal is to review a blue team's fiscal year 22 priorities. So we have three main initiatives and we will go in detail to each of one of them. First one would be the Internet facing asset assessment. That's something we're already doing this year, but for fiscal year 22 we have Chevron Improvement Area area so we can push this topic quite further. Will build new capabilities with new assessment capabilities and we will extend the scope of the current assessment. The current AH scan tools we are using. We will use and deploy and use a risk IQ to assess and discover all Internet face assets. We will want to feed that those assets into the CMDB so our inventors are more complete. We have an additional source to check against. Show Rescue will identify risk services. It will identify configurations, misconfigurations on the system, ***** abilities, software versions which are obsolete or problematic, and need an update and so on. This is something we are already doing with different rescues. This Corcoran bit site and so on, but we hope that risk you will be quite more complete in that sense. Also, for the Internet scanning right now we are using only an infrastructure scan. And we would like to go into our application scanner that would deliver a much more thorough review on the website configuration on the application side and so on. Disable will need to a contractor license tool and then also operate it and see how to work. On top of that one. Thank you very much that covered everything we wanted for today.",4.0

We are able to see different evaluation areas with the specific details and then you can drill down and go into the finance area. Or you can see. Specifically, every finding you have a uh, they left all the filtering capabilities. You can filter by risk vector.

But now we are onboarding risk you. This is an attack surface management tool that will provide us and has visibility identifying healthiness assets on the Internet and detecting misconfigurations, vulnerabilities and so on. We do want for sure to integrate those booties into folders as well as security scorecard, and it's like vulnerabilities so we can leverage, you know, the workflow lifecycle workflow it provides. We will also want to see how we can integrate how we can fit those discovered assets into the CMDB. This will help for sure improve our inventories. Where application scanner we are testing quiz where application scanner it is much better treated than the bone ability scanner. We are using our days for website analysis because quality right now is much more infrastructure focused. We also want to compare queries with nexpose nextpos.

"So if you're asking yourself why, why your paintings? Seems a little bit EH2 dimensional and do not get the three dimensional that they should reflect. So the reason for that is that maybe you are a little bit weak with your tones on the paintings. It's really important to understand that that um plays a really important role. Within the three dimensional of the of the painting. When the while the line. Create the dimensions the tones. Create the volume. Let's for that I would like to give you some some short introduction about about the tones and about their importance. See in your completeness of painting, when for that I will demonstrate that with this drawing. So as you can see, we have a ball and. The ball is under a underlighting. And this lighting is creating this shadow so we can. We can speak on three regions of these drawings. We have the light area. We have the shadow area or the form shadow area and we have the casted shadow area. For the Indy Light shadow area we we we see the highlight. The highlight is where the light hit directly so it's completely perpendicular to the light rays. Around it we have the halftones. Which are actually the. The the medium or the average between the highlight and then the shadow. Slowly as we go away from the highlight, the halftone becomes more and more dark. And then we are reaching the split lines or the the. The core shadow this is that this is the most darkest, darkest place in the drawings in the drawing. After that we will have. We will have the midtones which are becoming more and more bright until you reach the area which is called reflected light. The reflected light is the light we receive from the environment. So if the ball is sitting on a page or is sitting on a on a on a floor, the rays of the of the light the main. Source of light hitting the floor and then coming back to the ball. It's really important to know that the brightness of this area, although although it looks really bright, it's actually much darker than the darkest part on the lighted area, and this is really important to remember and really important to implement. And then the third part we have is the cast shadow, the cut shadow. It depends on the on the the light. If the light is very strong and the edges of the of the cut shadow are very sharp as well. If the if the light source is is very fuzzy or very obscure, then also the edges are very smooth. So we have the ambient occlusion which is the darkest darkest places placed below where the. Exactly where the ball touches the floor. Here the light does not come in, so it's really, really dark. It's almost completely black. As long as we move from the front there it becomes more and more bright. This is the biggest part of that of the cast shadow, and then we are reaching the area of the soft tail which is. That the the brightest part of the of the of the casted shadow. And this is because it's it's because it's remote from their object. It is very fuzzy and very blurry. So. You learn all the all the basic.",3.0

"We see the public transportation and traveling with bike in Europe is. Easy, think again. Let me tell you a story. My family and I just finished it a bicycle tour on the Danube and we reached Vienna and our plan was to take a bus. Back to London. I was with my wife and our two children and we booked a bus with places for the bikes on this bus. When we went to the bus station. After actually one week of trip where we really want to go back home when the driver tried to put my daughter back on the rack of the path, he just could not do that. It didn't fit. So the solution was sorry I cannot take you. We will give you your money back. But we cannot take it. I cannot take you, so we have to find a way to come back. We traveled to the. To the train station and we manage after a lot of discussion to find. Places four places in the train back to pass, uh, which is sitting the border between Germany and Austria. Unfortunately, in Austria you have to have also place for bike. The tickets lady helped us book 3. Three places on one wagon and one on the other one. So I decided with my wife. That she will take her bike and I will take care of the kids because I would. I would need to bring those bikes up. Then suddenly I got a phone call from my wife and she said that the train the second part of the train has not reached yet and she cannot. Put her bike anywhere. What should she do? I told her you have to just run two to us no matter what before the train is traveled, it's traveling. So she was running and I was waiting for her on the on the bottom of the train. On one hand, looking at the kids so the train will not close the doors and and travel and on the other hand to see that we are not missing my wife. The problem is because the train was is curved, it was not difficult to see my wife until we did the last moment she was. She was there. Luckily I just took her her bike, put it somewhere on the train and this is how we traveled. At least she did not find herself in a different country or in different zone.",6.0

We had to find creative solution to come back with the train. Which almost caused us to get separated and my wife to be on a different train traveling somewhere else in Europe. The only luck was that we had our mobile phone together and she called me and explained she had a problem and that she had the time. The short time to run from one end of the train to another in order to join us and put her back on the train. So be careful when you're planning those trips.",4.0
"After we all heard. That the chances to eliminate the climate change is not possible. I believe that the world now has to address 2 main topics. One is to continue. And think how we are reducing the effect of the global warming. What can we do? What can countries do in order to minimize this effect? By creating new technologies by thinking how we are living. Pollute pollution technology to acknowledges which make pollution and how we're going to more clean energy. This is something that has to be addressed very seriously, because although maybe it will not be possible to eliminate the change, we have to be sure that we are minimizing the effect. In parallel. You also have to think from the point of view that climate change will happen and therefore we need to clean and in advance how the humankind is prepared for such changes. So when the next generation will. Experience that they will be ready to cope with this situation. And here we have to have technologies which handle for for instance the. The problem in the cities which are lying on the shores where the level of the sea is getting higher, and maybe those cities will not be able to exist anymore. So we have to think about ways to move those cities inland. We have to think about how to handle with higher temperatures and with all the effects that those higher temperatures. Have on on on the human being. So my perspective, those 22 main topics has to be addressed parallel and without any compromise.",5.0

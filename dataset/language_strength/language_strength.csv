"I see operations in Chicago as two arms, 1 being facilities operations and one being client operations. I envision that the facilities lead operations team member will manage not only. Facilities eh VIT support for everyone within the Chicago office, but that also helps the team. The larger team in Chicago understand, um, you know what is needed, who is able to help and how to be the liaison between those two. Um, I think the facilities operations lead will really be responsible for everyone in the office. Um and this. Is anything or or at least in making it seem, that everyone in the office is their client? Um, and really being that trusted guide to help them? You know, with any issue troubleshooting any issues that they may have. Um, this is also. Ensuring food is properly stocked. Snack wise. Um, in the office as well as ensuring that any large meetings will have the IT Navy support that is necessary so that everything is running smoothly and there's no last minute um needs for help. Um, you know, looking for that forward thinking person to really be on top of it? I think the other arm of this is client operations and this is someone. Who works directly close closely with finance and the leadership of the of the Chicago office. They would help manage not only client burn and client teams and how they manage their accounts, but also kind of seen any repetitive patterns that they can pull out and kind of help smooth or iron out those wrinkles. That could be anything from meeting with Department's to try and understand the situation, but then also to. Um, you know, kind of relay any of those issues that you may see along to management, so they can help kind of manage down and and level set expectations for their team. But this is also someone who can help troubleshoot in the same way that the facilities operations manager can help facilitate and troubleshoot any issues.",1.0
"My. Me and my management philosophy is. Very much one that is laid back. I do not want to. I do not like micromanaging um people, I don't. I don't think I'm very good at it, nor do I, um. Like to micromanage and adults, I think we're all in a spot that we don't need to be told every day. What to do, um? I also think that I work best in situations that are more collaborative, so I appreciate um when I take an issue to my manager and we just talk about all the different solutions that are possible and the pros almost verbalizing a pro and con list, which with each um with each item that you know, um. With each item that I'm trying to troubleshoot, I like coming to the table with um. I like when people come to the table with some potential solutions and then we can kind of work through those together.",1.0
"Um, my team and Chicago my operations team I am operations is a pretty small team in Chicago, so we've got myself a senior senior operations manager and I work mostly with. Finance team as well as the client teams to help them, you know, track burn forecast appropriately, as well as helping them when their forecast is maybe a little off or their burn is a little too high. You know, I kind of help them dig into understand the whys behind it, and then maybe you know, troubleshoot some solutions that we can, um, put forward to either stop that or mitigate as much as possible. I do this with various other team members, not all in operations. Um, one of my closest counterparts is probably the finance team, Sarah O'Toole and we really do work together to understand utilization and try and find those trends of overburn or trends of under burn and really try and get to the bottom of the why behind it. I do have a counterpart, Sarah Sandra. Sandra is my right hand woman. Um, when it comes to the facility side of the house. So she really helps manage um meeting rooms. She does a lot of expenses for executive level folks, as well as just overall being the the bright and shiny person that we need in the office. Um, she really does handle quite a bit and she juggles a lot of balls. Um, she answers a lot of emails. Um, with lots of 1 off questions, which from an office of 350 there's you know one offs can kind of add up quite a bit. All of that led by my manager, Bruce Davis. Bruce is a really great resource for me. Um, he's just great to bounce ideas off of and troubleshoot together as well as helping me, um. You know, learn and grow in my career.",
"My manager, Bruce Davis, is a managing director of operations. He sits within the Kalamazoo Office and manages West not West but Midwest I guess, so he manages Kalamazoo, um, Detroit and Cincinnati. Chicago, and I believe, Minneapolis, um Bruce is a great manager. He really is just ideal when it comes to pulling reports. He's just got such a wealth of knowledge when it comes to. That sort of stuff. Um, Bruce really helps with, um. All the office leads and managing helping them understand how to manage their teams or their office is the best. He really does allow a lot of flex, um, and then he also reports into Craig Brush so any really large system wide issues, you know Bruce is really good at um at taking those in and you know appropriately reporting them back up. Um, you know any anything that we may see or that he sees from from his um. Land standpoint I guess.",
"Um high. Just wanted to sit down with you and discuss a few things that may be difficult to hear. Just try and keep an open mind, um. We've I've noticed that in the last two months there might have been some. Kind of slacking of responsibilities when it comes to deliverables, um. And I'd really like to understand why and and if there's anything that I can do to help support um, you know, if there's been some challenges, or if anyone has um made anything difficult, um, happy to help and help troubleshoot, help help. Kind of weed out the noise, um, and allows some more focus if that's what's needed. Um? You know, along with these deliverables we've I've also noticed. Um, negative attitude. A little bit less of a. You know there's there's been an attitude shift, um, and really just trying to understand if there's anything that I have done, or if there's anything you know within the team structure that's really upsetting. Um, or just not working the way that you have worked in the past? Um, because it has been in the last two months that there's been this shift. So really trying to understand what's happened in the last two months and see how I can help. Um, you know, you're a vital part of this team and I would hate to see you know this this two-month. What's been happening for two months. Extend further and you know you've always been such a great ally for this team that I would. I hate seeing that this downward swing, um.",1.0
"Alright guys, we've got this puzzle. Here's what I think we should do. I think we should break up and each person can have their own set of responsibilities. One I think we will wait. I think we need. I think we should split up two people. Um, two people find tiger pieces to people, find polar bear pieces, and the 5th person will go around and at least work on the edging and then hopefully we can just break a break it up into smaller pieces and really get at it. And we've got this. We love polar bears. We love tigers, so let's do it. And we got this.",4.0

One of the most consistent feedbacks we've had. Is that people appreciate easily accessible. Small efforts that allow them to participate on a regular basis. To that end, we want to recommend that in each office we should provide. Mindfulness. And meditation coaching. Once a month. Each day of the week, at the end of the month, for one hour sessions, given the flexibility we have of which days people come to the office.

"My day and I colleagues and I believe strongly that the use of our WOW program. Drives our peoples and teams morale to a much higher level. The WOW program. Gives people recognition not only to get a timely and direct. Thank you. Recognizing and acknowledging their contribution, but also creates a record that goes to their managers. So it allows for that recognition to flow through to their PNP ratings. Especially where those colleagues are being recognized by the WOW programs for their contributions today and I. Where their managers would not have visibility necessarily to those contributions. Our pecan results show a favorable score of 16 plus above the average. In regards to people feeling recognized via the Whale program and the transparency that gives to their DNI efforts. Thank you.",9.0
"Hello, my name is Ben and I apologize for my location and noise. Today I'm reporting from a noisy Starbucks, but in talking about, um, my plan for my team. I think one of the 1st and most important places just start, especially in the industry that we're in in marketing is to start with everyone's interests and figure out what they're most passionate about and what specifically brought them to this career. And this, um, this job and this company. And figure out how we can use that to strengthen not only themselves, but the team. And the work that we do, and from there, I think setting themselves up for success, and that is of course giving them space to. Lean into the strengths, but also opportunities to grow in the in the places that they need to grow in, and the opportunity is based off of that. I guess you know in a nutshell, it's creating a space for people to create their own individual journeys and development plans for themselves, and being someone there to support them.",1.0
"Um, to put it concisely, to talk about my management philosophy, I would say that it is all centered around transparency. I think that um, especially where we find ourselves in a remote or hybrid remote working environment, um, individuals need as much information on the work in selves in order to be set-up for success. And I think that I'm all come to fruition. Transparency, what I know about them as a employee and a contributor to the team. The feedback that I'm receiving and also um, how I view and observe them, but also about the work itself. Setting them up for success with all the correct information and being as transparent as possible about expectations and KP eyes and all of that information so that they have it to apply to the work they're doing.",5.0
"My team is divided between three different groups of people based off of their craft skills. The first one would be on the social team, specifically strategy team, which really is in charge of setting the vision for the social and digital practice for the agency as well As for individual clients. The second would be, um, our publishing team, which is mainly responsible for them. Executing the work that, um, the strategy teams compare teams. I've been putting into practice and then third, but of course not least would be our engagement team, which is spending the majority of their time interacting with people in the social and digital spaces. Um, with those three, um, unique apps on printer, well-rounded group of people really focused on the social and digital practice, um, from. The strategy and vision all the way to interaction people once the work is put out into the world I think would also makes the team extremely special, is not just the craft skills that we bring to the table, but also the personal and leadership skills that are unique to every person at every different section of the discipline.",
"My direct manager is a UM, director of UM connections for the agency. In her role, UM, first and foremost, of course, is to help set the vision for our clients, but also at that level, setting the vision for the social and connections practice at the agency. Also, as a leader, um, one of the most important aspects of her role is cultivating in building a, um, extremely strong. Um culture and team relationship and helping to um disseminate important information to the teams that report into her.",
"When delivering um, difficult messages to people and giving them feedback, I think one of the first things that should happen is talking about the expectations of the situation. So I would start with um, discussing what I thought, which should happen in terms of deliverables on time effective work in communication, and then going into what actually happened. So late deliverables, ineffective communication, and then going into the impact of that. So talking about how when we're late on deliverables, it causes the entire workstream to be held up roads, trust with clients that we would be able to deliver effectively. If it's for communication leading to swirl or confusion. And then, um, second, you know, most important would be developing an action plan based off. So after kind of talking about expectations would actually happen, and then the impact of that going into how are we going to plan for this not to happen? This, I think, is you know, moment to have a more human conversation with people and relate to them talking about what's getting in their way. What can? How can I or the agency or the team set them up on what barriers can we remove and then? Developing a plan to make sure that this action is corrected.",3.0
"OK, so we only have a few minutes to complete 100 piece puzzle. It can seem overwhelming to do that in such a short amount of time, but I think the best way for us to get this done is to break it into a few smaller tasks and each work as a team for the larger goal. So we have a polar bear. A tiger. I say some of us take the white pieces, the white furry pieces and start trying to organize that based. Off of building together the polar Bear tigers, I think they have stripes, so let's start also separating um stripes from the white pieces to start trying to create the tiger. We also know that puzzles have, you know, the middle pieces, and then they also have the, um, the edges, and so from there. Once we have the polar bear and the tiger pieces separated, let's start working on that. But also I think you know we're a team. Let's have fun doing this together because if. We don't win. It's alright. At least we had some fun in the process and learn how to build a puzzle in just a few minutes.",1.0
"My plan for my team, my ultimate goal for Creative Services is to help the team grow and what that means is several different things that could mean growing our team in the skill set that we provide. Growing our team in size and the clients that we work on growing in the engagement across the agency and growing in. You know the way that our reputation has can be. Affective in the agency. That could also mean having team members move off of our team and when they have expanded their skill set to a certain degree, have an interest in leaving the team. That means that we would be able to continue to have better context throughout the agency, and then that would lead to more growth. Ultimately, the goal for Creative Services is for it to be a.

"My management philosophy is that I want to empower my team members to ask smart questions to get the answers that they need to get the results that they need to do their job properly. Um, I want to set high standards for the team and then give them the tools that they need to meet those standards. I need to understand that that looks a little bit different for everybody, so that's another part of just giving people if they need different sets of of tools or different ways to work than understanding that that can look a little bit different for every person on the team, but empower them to ask more questions and. Find their best way to get to their best results.",5.0
"The role of creative services at the UM INR, I think is to be a stellar creative team that offers support to client alignments in a cost effective way and what that can look like is finding the right talent to fulfill a specific project need or roll at any given time.

Is incumbent upon us to have people who can kind of parachute in help out on something and then leave with having finished the work delivered great results and been useful and effective for the teams, and I think that that is really what creative services is at. The um, INR to do and what we should be best at.",

I don't need them being, um, experts of of excel or or teams, or any of the, um, productivity applications. They need to be experts in video editing software and and everything. That goes with that. And to do that, I plan to, um, identify onnable's for each of these editors to which they can. That helped the other parts of our team, whether it be for. Say uh, identifying sound effects and, uh, process there or how we organize our files on our server. Or, um, just keeping up to date with the software that we're using. Those kinds of things. The idea of being that they are able to help each other. Uh, by individually identifying skill sets that are their strengths and and educating the rest of the team on what they're they're good at and what they're doing. That being said, there are. Those are all things that I feel like I've spearheaded an, and now in the position to delegate to the rest of the team. So my plan is to take those things that I have been doing and not been doing well enough as I'm not able to focus on each of these tasks and um, find team members that that can do that while guiding them and being. Available as a resource to them as needed. Um, for them to become experts in each individual area that they are focusing on. And on top of that, finding. Finding ways to coach and mentor and just in general guide the team in the skill sets that are the editor skill set um. And with that being said, hopefully in just a few months will be in a great spot. Everybody will kind of be be showing good level of growth and competency in all the areas of our editorial practice.",1.0
"Sorry is a management philosophy. I'm relatively new to all this, so I haven't really been able to establish a philosophy. Um, the one thing that I think is is guided me to where I am currently is that I'm I focus on support of the team. Um, it was. It was mentioned by my boss, Scott Stone, that when when you become in a leadership role management role that you're not. Your team does not service you. You are you are there to service your team and be there to to assist them. It's almost a reverse philosophy on supporting the team. You push them up as opposed to bring them up to you. They don't come to you, you come to them. And help them through their work. So short answer is, um, I'm in service to my team members.",1.0
"So the vault editorial team is built of really strong roster of editors we've got. People from New York, Miami, Chicago, Seattle, really across the network. Uh, female INR and and we. Service department with with just about every need for video work. Whether that is, you know, internal videos, meeting videos, case studies and beyond to all the way to broadcast. As you know, but the the group that we have is is diverse they've got. Each unique talents, but together we put together a very good team of editors that will cover just about any edit we need. Matthias is very strong, very thorough out of Miami, Um became known to the to the higher up creatives over the case city season for for just how good he was. Bray is great with hype videos and sound effects and. 8 and Morgan coupled strong female editors that really do um ocean. Well, Blair comedy. She's great with that. A couple more junior editors that started um Caleb and Gabriella both strong in their own respect but. They helped round out the team with their their junior skill sets to assist as needed.

He is always on top of it. He's just a great personality. He's somebody that people respect and admire. And um. And philosophically, I strive to be more like him and then Scott Stone, who heads up the department. Um, just incredibly talented in the programs we use and and without.

"If if I see that any of the editors on my team are underperforming, not. Living up to or not not fulfilling the expectations that I have for them. Um, definitely just sit them down. Almost make sure mentally they're OK if there's anything happening that that's. Not necessarily in my business, but personal life issues that could be affecting their work life, and they're output at work. First and foremost, always want to make sure I've got a strong team mentally, then from there explain kind of what I've I've seen. As far as what was lacking was missing, and, um. Uh, you know, go go through through the expectations that I have and why those are not being met from there, um. Assuming that. There's nothing. Um? That needs to be addressed as far as their their, their personal personal life or anything like that that's affecting their work would go through and discuss. Involving myself in in in their day, UM communications and and what their output is and setting up. Uh, you know, uh, a goal to see, see improvements.

"So health and Wellness is really the building block of our society and as a result it's really what people are talking about online. But the reality is the industry is very far behind the rest of the world, especially when it comes to trying to talk to consumers. And the reality is that. There's a reason for this, which is that the guidance is VAD maddeningly vague. There we are still working off of draft social media guidance from 2014 that has not been finalized and has not been updated, so it makes total sense that our clients are nervous about taking leaps of faith into the space. But this is where consumers are, and we're going to need to be there. So the goal for the connection social health team is to really help be that bridge providing the link to the 21st century to social health and making sure that we are going to be providing the expertise in the category for how social works, how we can support all of our clients. And really help them understand the value of being on social, how it works and really educating them on what is even possible and continually pushing them to get there. The thought process is that we're really when you think about us. Think about us as.

This is how are a couple options of how you can achieve this and I really want people to go and try and come back to me and then we can react in terms of what it looks like, where it should be I.

Groups in the building. Health is more regulated than even the most regulated industries that you can even consider more than government. More than finance and at the same time, it's really important that we understand who we're talking to because it's a very very personal category. So my team are all folks who are both very excited about the future and what's going on in the latest and greatest. Steps of social media and being just as engaged with the. Latest consumer trends. The latest news as. Anybody who's working in a category, UM, but at the same time they also need to be willing to constantly have eh or able to have a positive attitude when they're being told no, and they're being told, uh? We can't do that over and over and over again, and at the same time they are helping to educate on the why. It's so important and how we can add value. So it's a really.

Both ourselves and the clients what we need. So if there's anything that. You are finding difficult or having problems with. Let's talk about it. I think the. They're important thing for our team is making sure that if there's something that you are stuck on or struggling with or you're kind of having issues, we can have that conversation and solve that problem and raise your hand early so that we can.

"Hi my name is Neely Spellmeyer and I am the head of proofreading at VML, INR and my team is small but mighty. We've got five people under me and they all are kind of part of our process. We aren't really set-up as necessarily a top down group. We all have kind of a democratic role in it. I like to make sure everyone has a voice and so I'm trying to help them develop those. Voices. Um, some people kind of already have. Assignments and areas that they take charge of, but my goal as a leader is to make sure everyone has a role and that there's something that they can do that makes them an expert on the team in certain ways so. The most important position I'm trying to help with is creating an assistant director or supervisor who is taking over in my absence, but also like building her own management style, and I want to really help her shape what she wants to be and how she can help our team and be collectively purposeful, so that is the first layer that I'm trying to create beyond that. There are four other people, and I'd like them all to have an area of expertise to help our team grow and thrive and make sure that things remain consistent. Because as proofreaders are most. Our biggest priority is consistency, and so if everyone can take shared ownership of some. Aspect of the work. Then we will continue to be more and more consistent, and they can pass it off to future employees and. Continue to create consistency within our organization. So that is how I would. Set-up my team structure and make sure that they are developing their own. Course or excuse me developing their own ownership of. An important aspect. Of our department.",5.0
"Hi, my management philosophy is Democratic. I think everyone in the team needs to know that they can have a voice and that they should have a voice and so no one is ever feeling left out of the procedures or left out of decision making. That is how I try and start everything. All new hires. Um, feeling that way. One example of this is recently we started creating a style guide that is. For the entire agency, and it was not just me writing down everything I believed, but instead it was, um. The team coming together, making the decisions together, making sure everyone felt they. Had a voice in it, which is my biggest priority.",6.0
"In terms of our team roles, we are very new team. We have just started creating a structure for that team so this is an exciting time where we get to define those roles and as supervisor I'm kind of the first step in that we've just created this position previously. It was just everyone was one group under another group and they weren't really connected. So now that we have our own team, I'm starting as a supervisor. I hope to eventually. Have an assistant supervisor. That position already exists. It's just not recognized yet she is. Um there as like a a major helper and everything I do. She assist me. Um, she helps me with. Management already, so to me the role already exists, it just hasn't been established so far. The rest of the team is made-up of a lot of doers like people who are just eager to help with the work, and I'd like to give them all roles in a specific expertise. Some already have them, one work specifically for one team. One focuses, focuses less on new business development work, which is a huge part of what we do. And does more on client work and so the rest of what I'm trying to figure out is how I make everyone have a special role that they can take ownership of. This is new like I said, so I'm trying to empower the reason for this class is to get ideas of how to make. Everyone have a specific role on our team beyond just the daily grind.",

Is to create a brand and part of my job is to create a brand has just done through images more and minus done through words.

My team is also located in multiple locations so we do not work on the same projects. We don't work in the same office so I am managing other campaign program managers. Two for another office that work on additional work, so my plan will be a little different in the sense that I'm I'm looking for that expertise of understanding how I can best manage a team when we are not specifically working together. So this is my preferred plan. Um, I would like to be invested in them, and knowing I've wrote this down so and knowing their personal goals, their personalities, work habits and responsibilities. So that I can provide accurate advice, my other would be I really want to be a model for their behavior. I'm going to lead by example. I want to be, um, you know, being a good behavior showing how great VML Y&R is being that advocate for something that they can strive for as well. I want to be really proactive about growth. Ah, I want to be able to find ways they can improve, whether that be a new task, whether it be I have a learning that I can share with them. I want to constantly. Share my knowledge, um, and be able to watch them grow as as employees. I also want to delegate responsibilities properly. So for my team I feel like they successfully understanding what they're working on and ensuring it's not that there is overloading their plate. They're doing the exact role they should be doing. Um, maybe it's a matter of hearing in our in our one on ones something that isn't typically done. Within our groups and recommending eh, a plan for them to delegate that to someone else. And then just honestly being flexible and open, so willing to provide new ideas. Be flexible, finding them new opportunities, knowing that we're now this new hybrid model open even to where they're working from all this kind of understanding that that's truly, in my opinion, is achieved. Success is when people are happy with their situation. Knowing every situation is different. Um, so yeah, I it's. It's really. It's kind of like I'm I'm looking for really strong of um, trusted integrity, want to develop them professionally by growing them. Um, I want to obviously treat others the way I wanna be treated to that golden rule. Um, and then yeah, just the flexibility because what we can do can always help each other.

Maybe it's a new form, maybe it's a new. Um? Process that the team has been taking forward. Um, I also have the the golden rule. My philosophy is still that true nature of treating others the way you wanna be treated. So the way that I would want to be managed I'm looking for that with my team. Which kind of pushes to that. Um, evaluations and opportunities. I want to constantly remind people what they're doing, right? I think, um, you know, hearing that is a is a great moment. Um, to constantly hear that from someone.

So a lot of it is the retail type of project management and then EMM, a primarily sits or primarily works on on resourcing and the just kind of starting the process out in project management. They are both go getters. There are truly just a joy to have conversations with and I feel like every time I'm meeting with EMM we do one on ones together. I'm learning information myself from them, especially being. That they are in different locations.

Maybe there's something going on personally that I'm missing that I'm not aware about. And while I don't need to hear every detail of that 'cause, that's up to them if they want to share that with me, it allows me to have a little bit extra space to give them that room to share or tend to be more open and flexible.

We're not handing it to them. We are putting it over so it's near their line of sight, but we're not distracting them by giving it to them and making them stop their process. So the most important thing is for us to work within our section so that when we are working together we are slowly coming inwards towards that puzzle to finish it as quick as possible, but that number one key is creating that border, so I would be taking if it is a landscape thing there would be grass at the bottom and white sky and blue sky the top like we would be indicating those.

So what we do and what we don't the way we do things templates and re buildable and repurpose able um materials. Um and three ER clients so we want to maintain our existing level of service. Continue to foster these client relationships and um really deliver on the elevated service that our clients love and meet their expectations. The number 2 growth area is client growth, so some key areas. I think we could unlock this year are within Wendy's Sherwin-Williams, Veterans United. LT's and Google, so here? Let's really focus on how we're selling the practice. Let's have consistency and how we're talking about it. And in our pitch decks. And evangelization so I want us to be evangelizing our practice throughout the company. So whether that be at Tuesday morning meetings, um. Other events where we can be talking about our thought leadership blogs on amp etc. The next and final key area of focus for this year is people growth. So as we develop more work on more clients, we're going to be adding more people to the team, so I'm going to be working on career ladders for everyone so everyone understands where their next steps are. Let's focus on development and key learning areas of opportunities for everyone, including events, recognition, training, and on boarding. How we're collaborating with our existing team members, especially as we grow and that were virtual. Let's have the pieces in place to be able to collaborate virtually or anywhere that we are, and we're going to be hiring, so we're going to fulfill unfilled scope and support upcoming scopes, and so we're going to be looking for talent to do that. That are the right culture fits for our team. Do you have any questions or feedback on this for me?",5.0
"My management philosophy is to really understand my team as people and treat them as people. So I really want to understand who they are, what their strengths are, and what they like working on, and what they don't like working on. I want to meet them where they are and really understand what scares them and what gets them excited. I want them to feel safe in their jobs from an emotional standpoint. I want them to know that they can talk openly with me and bring their concerns to me without feeling scared of retaliation.",6.0
"Our team is the mobile app marketing and lifecycle practice at VM Y&R. There are four of us on the team. We are one to one marketers who understand the unique marketing and lifecycle strategies for mobile apps. We've really focused on five key pillars within mobile marketing and that's the life cycle strategy for the mobile app. Acquisition of new users, engagement and retention of existing users. And nurturing them to retire levels of engagement, reporting and analytics of mobile apps to tell the story of the app and App Store optimization. There's four of us on the team.

"My boss is Adam Jones, who's the group director over mobile apps and emerging technology, so there's really 2 pillars when it comes to the mobile app practice at VM Y&R. One is the design and development of the app and so this really encompasses the product owners who are working with the client on the road map and strategy of what the app experience itself should be. And the second pillar is more of the marketing of the mobile app. So how are we going to, you know, once the experiences created? How are we going to acquire users and engage them through messaging and other channels and so those are really the two pillars of mobile apps and Adam Overseas. Though to those two pillars and I'm the leader of the app lifecycle pillar so he really can oversee those and help vet mobile app experiences holistically and then filter those rolls down through those two pillars.",

We want to make sure our clients are happy and they feel that their their dedicated media teams are delivering quality work and are responsive to all of their needs. Secondarily, I think she ensures team happiness, so making sure that all of the media teams and the individual players on those teams are fulfilled and what they're doing. They're happy they enjoy their job, which in turn creates good work for our clients.

So just making sure that you're not overwhelming them, but also your challenges EMM continually and also that everybody works well together. Everybody rowing the same direction and and working towards the same client goals and overall just making sure that we're doing good work. That's the most important thing. Um and then making sure we also have good work life balance. Um, so if I notice there working consistently more than 40 hours a week, making sure that we're addressing that because you're going to burn yourself out if you do that. Um, are we taking breaks enough to where we do fun team building activities? You know, going out to lunch together as a team, just making sure that while we focus on work as our priority, we also have enough time to make it. Like a family atmosphere.",1.0

Consider things that they normally wouldn't have because that's our role of an agency is to make sure that if we're bringing ideas to where it's on strategy and its agreement, in agreement with what the overall goal is. But it's they're not quite there yet, that we are continually pushing them. So I think the primary goal is making sure the clients are happy as far as team, that would be secondarily, but still very important just to make sure that there is a good balance between doing great work, but also there's enough brakes to where we are.

He does great work. He's young, but he's very ambitious. Which is great because anything you throw at him, he'll gladly take on, but he needs more seasoning. It's not there yet to where we can put him in from the client and have him lead the meetings, but he'll get there. Clair, she's a professional. She's great, she's very introspective. She's quiet, so you really have to ask her and draw the answers out of her because she won't be forthcoming with what how she's feeling and the current situation of things. She does. Great work quiet, but once you get her talk and she'll start, you know, being more transparent. Um, Bill, he is capable, but he continually needs a lot. Reassurance his growth is slower than Jim and Claire's, but I think he will get there as well. Just, you know, needs a little bit more management, a little bit more massage to make sure he he's hitting our our benchmarks. Debbie, that's one that I'm actually having to concerns about. She's been here for eight months and really I haven't seen much improvement at all. Um, she doesn't seem to have. A lot of knowledge or confidence in what she's doing. She has a deer in headlights. Look a lot um, and I will have to explain things to her 234 times before she even gets it. If at all not even close to being in front of the client to presenting the ideas.

"Hi, I'm Michelle Sanchez and I'm the talent director of North America, and I have five other talent managers on my team across North America and what I really would like to do is to have a turnkey process for influencer and celebrity negotiations. For all of our clients. And currently we are struggling to kind of be proactive versus reactive and I'd love to make it a little bit less drama, drama free. That is, um, So what I would like to do is to be able to have some sort of request. Form that the C team that fills out when they get these sort of requests and they would send it to our team and we could assign a talent manager that would work on this specific project from start to finish followed by a process template e-mail to see teams so that they know what to expect moving forward. One of the first things that I'd like to implement is a kickoff meeting with the producer, the production business manager Talent Mandarin C team so that we all get on the same page. Other questions and go from there. The second thing is with the processes to ensure that we get a client signed estimate, uh, creative love letter to the talent agent and talent and also on any other costs associated for legal, signed and ready to go. Once we get all of that information & off from client then we can extend the firm offer to the talent agent which includes the creative brief and the monetary compensation that would go with the offer as well as starting to draft. The legal long form agreement with legal and get it blessed by both client legal, our agency legal and you know, kick off negotiations from there and then. Hopefully it's all smooth and we can also understand who the stakeholders are as we are getting red lines back. There's a lot of parts of this contract that are usually over 12 pages long that I'm not only invested in or on my team, but other stakeholders need to be a part of, so we need to have an action plan. The Minette, because these timelines are so sensitive. Um Dutta Productions we need to make sure that the minute we get a red line back from either side of legal, we know who needs to jump on a call immediately to go through the contract in an efficient manner. And so I'm just hoping that once you start instilling these processes it becomes less reactive and just more streamlined and efficient, and so that we're not scrambling to understand who needs to. You know, move things back and forth to make it to the production. Thanks.",1.0
"Hi again, I'm just really always as a manager. Tried to treat others the way I wanna be treated. I also have learned you know that I don't appreciate in the past when I've been micromanage so I I try to avoid that sort of style of managing. I also really want to be approachable and just be like a cheerleader and a support system for everybody on the team. No matter what, what level they are currently in their career and I want to hear what they want to do in their career. Like do they want to grow? Do they want to pivot to another? Part of production. I'm just there as an advocate for whatever they want, 'cause at the end of the day I want them to have work life balance to be happy and healthy, and I do believe that people leave um band managers in bed. You know, people within organizations and not necessarily the company itself, and so I really strive to like you know what is keeping them here. It's me being like, you know, uh, uh, an advocate for what they truly want day today. And so I truly believe that I want to give them the tool belt.

"Hi there, yes our department um has four talent managers that work day today across North America on all of our clients. We also have Gordon for court who is specific to celebrity and strategy negotiations. So we are able to support, you know from start to finish scale productions and also do celebrity influencer negotiations. Three of our regular town managers can also do influencer and celebrity negotiations. It's just that Gordon is the lead. Another great thing that we also have within our department is that Gordon has brought some of his great platforms that he's used to working with that previous agencies called captivated the pole and they're great resources for clients, such as like Coker Intel who want to kind of, you know, have celebrity. They have a priority list celebrities and it will give them information regarding the reach um and how to you know, like how they have reach in like Europe versus North America. What's their demographic target? What's their Instagram account? That sort of thing. And so we can really great create specific to each celebrity a presentation for clients if they need that sort of like extra, um, security blanket, unlike approaching a firm offer with with a celebrity also, just you know our our talent team is just growing when the influencer space as well. And so we are constantly working in the influencer space. And we're here to be able to partner with any clients and see teams if needed and happy to set-up another meeting. one-on-one, uh, specific projects if you need so.",
"So I report to the head of production of North America, Tyler Smith, and I have to say. The reason why I believe that I've becoming even better manager the last two years at VML Winery is because of Tyler, he's really been able to let me lead and not be a micro manager, but yet we check in every other week. Obviously we talk, you know, in between on, you know, day-to-day things, but he really listens and takes action. So in the past I've had managers that just listen, but don't show actions and follow through, but he actually does. He's helped me have open roles and higher. On three additional people, since I started, he's helped us get new platforms that are resources to our talent team specifically, and he's also helped with anything. Basically like that I need. Or, you know, is able to, like, you know, respond to a text or a message when there's something you know, uh, an issue that he needs to elevate to senior leadership for approval. And so I just feel like he's really been a wonderful, you know, partner within the department that I can go to and.",
"Hi there, so I wanted just to meet with you and have an honest conversation of some critical criticism that I received from another manager that was in a meeting that you've been in. I know we won that new client which you had, you know, said that you were you able to take the lead on and happy to do so and kick off the production. But I've been hearing that. You know in the last few meetings you haven't spoken up at all or said anything to be engaging. You know questions and asking. About the client. In order to onboard it and you know another manager that was in that meeting and was hoping that you would speak up at sometimes, and they felt that they had to speak up because you are not. So I just wanted to get your point of view on that. Sometimes you know when there's like 25 people in a meeting. You know even myself. I have to like use them. It was you to like raise your hand if you're not in the same, you know. As the other people and then you can kind of, you know, you know chime in when you when they call on you. It's also good to, you know, write down your questions if it is kind of getting crazy and then maybe send a recap e-mail. But I think it's really important that you know you are presented as a trusted asset in the talent department so that the you're like approachable and seen and heard. You know turn your camera on, you know, make small talk with people and make sure that they know who you are because it also with working. Components hard because you're not sitting next to someone and having that small talk cooler water cooler talk because I want them to be able to know that all the talent managers are strong leads and can lead um clients and especially this new one which is really important so I'm happy to continue to work with you know you and hear from you. What are some of the reasons why? Maybe you weren't as local and on boarding the client initially?",1.0
"OK, I love puzzles. Let's win. So I think what we should do. And I'm open to suggestions. What if we all start looking for the pieces that are the border of the puzzle first so that we can start building the outline? And so let's put all those in a pile and start trying to figure that out. And why don't we start breaking it up into four like you know 4 sections and so that we can see. Like you know the upper left hand has like the polka dots with the red. So let's start finding all the puzzle pieces that aren't on the border. To put in piles that go, possibly with that section and do the same thing with the other sections. If anybody has any other ideas. I know you know every time we do this it's like super fun and sometimes it gets frustrating. But I think whether we win or lose let's go get ice cream after. But let's start doing that. I think that will be helpful, and it's always nice to you know, do something that has nothing to do with work and it's just kind of fun and brings us back to like our childhood and doing puzzles and it kind of makes you think on, you know, just the puzzle and kind of takes everything else away and resets it for like you know, a good day. So let's have fun and try to.",2.0
"So I always feel uncomfortable saying what my plan is because I feel like plans or collaborative, so that's where I'll start. Um, I'd like us to be a team that is. Collaborative is one that seeks out other opinions, seeks other points of view, seeks out things that they don't know. Secondly, I want us to be a team that's proactive and adds value. I want us to look around and be curious about how things work, fine, places where we can add unique value. Put our mark on things. I want us to be in organizing force within the agency and for our client we are information people. Which also means that we're good at organizing things. It's another way we add value apart from specific deliverables and reports. And then lastly being an engine for agency growth, the amount of data that is out there in the world is growing exponentially, which means we need more people to understand and synthesize the data into meaning into knowledge. It also means our clients need the same things. So as a quick recap, you know my vision and one that I want to work with the team on is about being collaborative is about being proactive and adding value is about being an organizing force within the agency and the. Client being an engine for growth, all things I think position us well for success position as well for our own personal growth and career opportunities and as good for our client as well. 'cause again, whenever we're adding value where we're providing something back for the money that they pay in. So that is my philosophy on things in terms of where I see our team going.",3.0
"So in terms of my management philosophy, I'd say there are a few things that are core to me. First one is I want to make sure that I can help you, so please don't surprise me with things. Um, if you surprise me with things are not going well then I can't help because they don't know about them, so I'd much rather that you come to me with those and we talk through them. You know, I, I want you to be trainable. I want you to be somebody who wants to learn. I want you to be somebody that is curious. About new things and about how things could be better. Um, wanting to be honest, I want you to be somebody that speaks their mind kindly but directly. And then lastly, attitude wise I just want you to be somebody that other people want to be around and want to be a part of a team with and that you feel the same way about your teammates. I want this to be a team, not a group of stars.",2.0
"So on my team I have two direct reports. At the moment I've got Christine Porter. She has a lot of potential as an associate director right now. Um, somebody I could see going into higher levels of management. Most definitely a calming presence, eh, knowledgeable presence, and willing to push back on deliverables where it's appropriate because she's not going to be able to get to the result that's being asked for or not in the way that it's being asked for, um. Just a great demeanor. Hasn't managed people a whole lot, so needs some work. Um, learning that, but I think has great natural potential. When is Justin he's a director on the account as well, but just somebody that's just come under me. But what I hear are fabulous things, and in the first few days working with him, he's been really good. He's got a little bit more of a dry sense of humor, which I can appreciate, um, but other than that, we're just kind of getting to know each other a little bit, but a lot of potential and a hard worker, and definitely knows his numbers definitely knows his, um.

Who's her boss is what it seems like she works a lot on pitching new business. She works on the. The existing clients that she has and then helps a lot. She's got a pretty wide range of people still reporting to her some which are kind of started reporting to me. But she also works on Arcpy. Um, overall framework and tools that help get people into that as well as department planning and budgeting and scoping and things of that nature.",
"I just need to start this off by saying this will be a little bit of an uncomfortable conversation. Um, we have a few things to discuss and I'm just kinda like those out here at the beginning and then we can talk a little bit more about how you feel about those and what might be impacting things. 'cause at the end of the day I want to try and find us a place where we can get the work done and that everybody is happy and that everybody feels like this is a good fit. But some of the things I've been hearing that I want to talk about is that. The team might be about to miss some goals and some of that is related to some deliverables that were missing from you and some attitude problems that I'm hearing about. So I want to kind of address each of those in turn and talk with you about what you think might be driving some of those comments and find out what might be impacting your work, if anything. If you if you feel that these are true, but we do need to sit and discuss them and kind of find a path forward again, because these are things that are going to impact the. Team being able to achieve their goals. So I want to hear from you a little bit about why we've missed some deliverables, and I have a few here to talk about. I want to talk about a few instances where people have felt like there was, um, either a miscommunication or that they felt like they were getting a little bit of attitude back, and I just want to talk about that. It's obviously a broad topic to say attitude, but I want to talk about it, and then we'll talk about how that ladders up to the goals of the team and at the end of the day, we just need to make sure that we're getting things done. And how that gets done? I'm not going to necessarily prescribe, but I do want to help make sure that you have the tools and that you have the processes to do things in the way that we're expecting and that you feel that that's fair.

Is that we all spend time digging through real quick to find all the edge pieces. At that point, once we find all the edge pieces, two people will break off to put the pieces together. Two people will start to quadrant off the picture and start to throw pieces in the best pile that you think you can for each of the quadrants, and then once we get the edges together, we will come back over and we'll each take a half of the puzzle one quadrant at a time and work through it to find the puzzle pieces and put those in and then move on to the next. If we have any other ideas. I'm open to those that's just a first cut at it, so feel free to let me know what your thoughts are on how otherwise we could organize this.",3.0
"Hi, I'm Caitlin, the client team that I represent at my agency VML Y&R is really still a relatively new piece of business, so there's still an investment period. There's still this this honeymoon phase that we're experiencing with the client that gives us a really great opportunity to really work out the kinks internally and with our client relationship as well to ultimately get to a more more powerful space where we can deliver a lot of strong work for our clients. So are our main goal across the board. Is to really deliver strong, creative strategic thinking that delivers on the client asks, helps them achieve their business goals, but while still being cautious of budget on our side, I think this is a really easy period of time where we can invest and show off everything that we can do, which is important to do at the start. But we're still a business. We still need to make money. So how do we wow our clients right out of the gate? Show them that they made the right choice. Choosing us in this new business. Relationship while also sleep being cautious of our bottom line. We're also working in a really interesting environment. Knowing that the majority of our internal team interactions are still digital. We're not in the office all the time together, and we have people on our team that live all across the United States, so not a lot of people have actually met in person to be able to deliver on the client requests and again bring forward that strong, smart, strategic work we have to make sure that we have really strong team morale. Internally and that we feel like a cohesive team, even if we are in separate offices across the country as a manager, I need to be able to make sure that I'm connecting with people across the country understanding what their needs are. Having those side conversations because not being in an office, you lose that opportunity for small talk and really understanding what your team is craving and how you can help them get to where they need to be. So a few action items that I have in mind for how I can continue to push my team in the right direction and really start to establish that strong client relationship is frequent conversations with our client. Understanding real time feedback from them. What can our agency be doing better? What are we doing great at already sharing that back with our internal team and finding ways to offer up our services for incremental projects to get that extra budget and get those extra opportunities. To show off our skills when it comes to getting new projects, working with our internal teams to have very clear calendars and staffing plans so no one ever feels overallocated or that they don't have the support they need to get the job done and then tracking that investment. Making sure that at the end of the day we're delivering what we need to do. But we're still having a really positive bottom line at the end.",4.0

This also gives me a chance to get to know them on a personal level. And identify any additional interests they have beyond their typical roles and responsibilities that I can help them achieve in the workplace. Um, I think this all starts with a basis of trust and respect. I trust my teammates to get their jobs done. I respect the decisions that they make. I'll help them out however I can, and I'll give them that recognition in front of the rest of the team that they're doing a great job all to help build and strengthen our relationship moving forward.",2.0

And again I apply this to myself, determine if those actions from those work streams and teams are aligned with each team member's personal and professional goals, what they call success. I think it's, uh, I think it is. Outside the organization's definite success, I think success is subjective to each individual. Um. Part of the plan is to align with team members on what their my cameras falling um. Remind with team members on. What they're working towards or want to work towards, not just within a title, but within accountability, responsibility and reward payment, um. On a slightly separate note, I would like. And I try to promote this amongst my team members for us to be bridge builders to us to be team connectors both within. VML winery and on the client side.

However, I think the fun culture stuff is important, um? I've got a couple others on the team that are one is contractor and main goal. There is. I really want to. Get this person hired as a direct employee. He makes great impact on every team he works in, and we've been dragging her feet too long on getting this guy hired um. His energy is awesome.

Excellent when he does. Um, always always vying for the promotion, always vying for the raise, but he works towards it, um. The concern I have is that he's been on the same account for over half a decade, and. I feel like he's may not have enough virtual experience across multiple accounts and different teams.

The third. Is it some other force or person or team out there? Um, first align on those. Things see if we're seeing we're actually seeing the same things. If not, get aligned. If so, then talk about the reasons, purposes, etc. I think. Some people need a fresh view fresh perspective from what they're doing. Some people need more guidance. More direction, um some people. Need um? To be kind of set free to do on there, you know, kind of make up their own rules. So depending on the person would be talking about, that's what I would determine is what this person need to succeed. Is it just removal completely to a different team? Is your middle from the company? Is it hopefully not, um? Is it just a kind of a fresh perspective on a new team, different stuff or they really? Are we really not utilizing this person and their skill sets correctly? I think we've all most of us have been in this situation. If not once more times in our career, and it's always a good.

Um, so at the end of the day, my plan for my team is to delegate more is to give them more responsibility and really empower them to find the work. Find the opportunities that we can kind of unite over. To deliver the best possible work for the client. Um, I think that sometimes my team I need to stop delegating at a tactical level and delegate more at a um kind of opportunity level. Give them the.

Like hey, if I know somebody's going to be better like edge pieces, or if somebody is going to be better at like finding you know colors or shapes, patterns that fit together well, you know.

I want to make sure that myself as a manager, um, have a level of trust with with anybody that I manage, whether it's a direct report, Aurora team situation, and I want that person to. No, that I have their back but also I I want them. I want to be obviously trusting of them as well, so I'm kind of working on that two way St to set-up a foundation for. Moving forward. I believe that that that foundation helps when it comes to tougher stuff when things aren't going as well and you need to provide feedback, having that solid foundation to go back on can make that feedback in turnitin more into a positive. Coming from a trusted situation. It also helps when there's turbulence from a team standpoint, we were my director for and I are transitioning to a new team, so like the fact that he has a.

"Hi, my plan for my team is for everyone to feel really well connected and grow within their own roles. So I would like to set-up the more of like a democratic management team. Um, so everyone feels super involved in the decision making process. Um, this will help everyone feel valued. It will boost morale. It will also help us engage healthy trusting relationships between manager and direct reports. I think I like this style of management because. It um, gives everyone responsibility and helps everyone feel like they're creating their own real work, and it utilizes all team members to their full potential. It also opens up the door for a lot more collaboration between team members as well. Um, and as well as an open relationship between manager and direct report, um, I'd like to have a plan so everyone feels that they can come to me as a manager. And we can have regular weekly one to ones or more if possible, so people feel aware of where they are falling. Um and people feel where they are achieving as well. This helps us, um, set-up expectations so when we go into those times where people have evaluations now things are shockwave. Kind of everything has already been on the table, um? And we can chat through more of those things in our one to ones as well. Um? I like to be. The plan is at the beginning of the year or every six months we evaluate where everyone wants to be and where everyone wants to grow so everyone is working in their full potential. If there's a problem anyone can come to me, um. Yeah, I think, uh, the plan is just that healthy working cell together, really. One second. The plan also would be that team members meet together regularly and we discuss plans together. Um everyones heavily involved. We also have a lot of trust a trusting relationship between us, but also other team members and then make sure everyone is involved in execution of plans. Everyone feels comfortable across, um, everything that we set-up together.

And what that means is I want to make sure that I get with them and create a plan, create a working plan for what they want to learn in their first. 30 days and their first five days and their first 60 and 90 days and really create tangible benchmarks and checkpoints for them to come back to. I I also want to create tangible benchmarks and checkpoints for them and me for for our relationship together, I want to make sure that. Our relationship is not one of only downward communication. I want to them to feel comfortable to grow into me and and and. Tell me exactly what they're feeling like. And in that note, I want to. Start creating checkins. You know whether those are weekly or biweekly um of 1 on one. Check in with them to understand how their feeling and how they feel like they can grow how they feel like you know. Maybe there's something wrong that has happened in that week or couple weeks, and so I want to understand. How they're feeling all the time not to micromanage, but to understand that they are part of the team. Secondly, after we we understand each other and our communication styles, I want to create a communication plan both internally and externally. How how does our team a benchmark for how our team communicates internally is going to really help them. You know whether it's teams, whether it's meetings, whether it's emails in person.

What we are seeing what I'm seeing now is that my team is jelling and growing into themselves, really taking responsibility for some of the things that that I would have had to push them to understand earlier. They're very young, right? They're very they're very young in their careers, and so I think for me, that means that I have to help them understand where they need to go, understand how the client wants things to be, and I think that's totally OK, and I and I think even now, we're beginning to move forward as a team where they're taking things on, and I've not reminding them one of the things that they are. They are a bit overwhelmed by the amount of change. Both inside our agency and even more so with our clients. There is so much movement in terms of people in and out and projects in and out there, they're getting overwhelmed. And so I'm struggling with how I can help them navigate that change other than saying we're going to be OK and sometimes that's not the thing they want to hear. Sometimes they want to hear more complex, more concrete facts on what's what's actually happening. So I you know, I think they're doing great as a team, but often are overwhelmed by the amount of change because they're not used to it. It's such a rapidly changing client that I think we all need help in understanding how we can navigate change together.",

Currently I'm touching about four pieces of business, and while the roles and responsibilities across all four of these accounts look a little bit different, both myself and my direct report NIA have an incredible relationship and a clear understanding of our connections teams, roles and responsibilities across our lines of business. So first on Johnson and Johnson Consumer Health, NIA is actually our day-to-day connections lead.

I'm actually the day-to-day lead, so I'm responsible for our social strategy, creation and and our reporting and NIA acts as our day-to-day community manager.

"Hi there, my name is Amity and I wanted to tell you about my plan as a manager. I manage two other direct reports who also managed their own direct reports. So when we have kind of a nonlinear reporting structure, I really make sure it's important to have a plan in place, a plan that's been vocalized to the entire team and that everybody knows that even though it's a structure of reporting. That there is so much flex and it's very open and transparent of who you can go to for any sort of mentoring or coaching or management needs. So I think of my plan as a manager as kind of a 3 pronged approach. So the first is nurturing growth and development against my team. I like to try to understand strengths and weaknesses of all of my teammates. As well as goals and things people don't actually enjoy doing, um, I like to try to put people in the right place at the right time. Based on these self on this self professed strengths and weaknesses. So for example, if somebody really enjoys content strategy, I like to put them in projects where they get to really show their expertise and grow the. In their discipline of content strategy and vice versa. If somebody says, I really don't like on, you know. Parts of content auditing I really don't like presenting the results. I feel really comfortable doing the work, but I feel more comfortable if somebody else presents. I like to make sure that they're paired up in a team where they don't necessarily have to do that. If it's not, um, part of their career trajectory. Secondly, I like to understand my team members short term and long term goals. So what I define as a short term goal is a goal in the next 6. To 12 months, what do you want to do? What do you want to get really good at doing? What do you want to do more of? What do you want to do less of so it plays very well with the first component? I also like to know long term. I'm thinking in terms of. Six or I'm sorry three to five years. What do you? What do you want to achieve? Where do you want to be career growth wise and then from? Everyone should look slightly different from mine because I haven't recorded, uh, I'm sorry about that. And lastly, I like to understand on from from a mentor perspective in a coaching perspective, what is it that I can learn from my team members? I think there's always push and pull in every relationship and I like to learn from my team members just as much as I can coach and mentor.",4.0
"My philosophy as a manager is pretty simple. It's my success is your success. So what that kind of breaks out to mean is, as long as my team members feel successful, feel fulfilled in their career. Feel like they're headed in the right track. I think I've done a good job as a manager. I try my best not to micro manage or provide oversight in areas. That are not necessarily needed. I tried to ask a lot of questions and gain a good understanding before reaching a conclusion. I try to manage my expectations and lead with empathy and I think understanding that.

So I just wanted to kind of have a very candid and open conversation. Um, what's going on? How is everything else in your personal life?

We have never worked before together and we've slowly kind of done a full on boarding to VML. She was new to VML, so my plan has been all along to bring her up to speed with the way that the agency works and then helping her showcase what her skills are and find her things that she's best at and then slowly developing her craft skills so that she can move up and find the career path within our connections department that fit her needs.

So my goal for my team is to keep them satisfied and feel like they're advancing in their careers while also still providing the client with the things that they need. So while the needs might become stagnant on some things, we're trying to find ways for her to become more efficient over time in which she will then be able to do things. Quicker and then start working on the things that she wants to do in addition to our base level job that helped her advance to the next level. So really, really excited about that for her. Um?

"Um, my way of my management philosophy is kind of changed during COVID. Um, seeing people in their home environments is a lot. Ah, see a fuller picture of who people are and helps us see who the person is, the spouse, the child, the pets, hobbies, friends, etc. So getting to kind of treat people, not just his workers, but is getting to see them as a whole person that has lots of different ways to contribute and things that they're passionate about. Um, think COVID is really shine. A light. On that, so from my side of things, I'd like to manage by having weekly one on ones at minimum to make sure that I'm up to speed with things that they're facing and it's bright support throughout of it. Provide updates, follow up on future and growth opportunities for them, and try to make sure that we are handling all things that are needed as they're coming up. So trying to be ever present.

We have community manager who is responsible for day-to-day listening to the community, searching out conversations about the brand, and finding ways for us to integrate and create content that would reach these users and tell them that we are listening and resonates with them in culture and things that are happening in the moment. Uh, additionally, we embed ourselves. With our analytics team to make sure that we are up to speed with what is performing well, what isn't so that we can better inform our creative team. We work hand in hand with them to inform them of best practices. Things that are changing in platforms every single week. Instagram is having a new platform updates. We work with them to make sure that they know what is up and coming. If it's a one by one video versus a four by five and maybe now a 9 by 16 real so the team is constantly trying to evolve and keep up to speed with. All the platforms as they change. Each user is responsible for our direct portion of it. So Jenny is responsible for listening community. As a community manager, I step in as associate connections director to help inform social strategy, broad and then above me is actually my boss Chelsea who steps in and helps connect with directors and above um over on the client side on scope of work, business expectations and contract renewal.

We have crucial times coming up where we need to kind of get this contract. We signed with these clients so trying to figure out a way to inspire the full team here to dive back into community kind of find out the routes that we have been so successful with back in the past. Is there anything you're noticing that's changed or different that might have caused an impact recently? Um, happy to kind of discuss, or if there's barriers, or if there's different ways of working that have changed this. We went on dive into those, but happy to listen to anything that has occurred or changed our way of working because we were so successful this past year doing most of this wreck work for these clients. They've been really excited about it. The community obviously been responding, but we just aren't seeing the same thing there. Um, happy to kind of discuss it further, though, um? As well, if there's ways that I can help remove some barriers, um, please let me know. I can get involved, can help kind of stretch the load a little bit and find ways for us to fill all motivated about this um. Additionally, if the work isn't as inspiring as it used to be, a happy to kind of discuss ways to find other elements for you to bring in and be able to.

I would like for them to expand their skills and their knowledge so that they can think beyond what they're used to and kind of extend their. Professionalism, their skills and their knowledge of content strategy. Specifically, I would like for them to stretch themselves a bit just so that they in some cases do feel uncomfortable because I feel that in that space of being uncomfortable is where you usually see the most growth. So I would like for them to learn to feel comfortable in that space and kind of live and thrive in there so that they can grow their skills and their professionalism outside of those. Things I would like them to. Really get to know each other and interact with each other because I feel that there's opportunity and speaking in engaging with others so that you're able to learn from others experiences and their knowledge is will and then of course I will. Of course I always want them to have fun and enjoy their environment and each other, so a lot of that I think has to do with like team building activities and just opportunities for us to get together and work. More closely together, especially with being, um, work from home, there's like. A lot of. Time that's spent kind of in our silos and just in our own environment, so as much as we can get together and be comfortable around each other. And, um, work alongside each other, I think that is just great opportunity to kind of grow and stretch beyond, you know our capabilities and skill levels that were used to working in so definitely, um, just to sum things up, grow and skillet and their knowledge. So I think that comes again with dealing with this space or and getting used to kind of thriving and living in the space of being uncomfortable. Growing and leadership as well and then growing as a team member and learning how to be, you know, a really. I guess impactful and, um, great team member to to the people that you're working with.

Um, whether that be different from the department goals or not, I would assume they would align into those greater department goals so that we can. Have that. Department goal, kind of as our mission and then our um?",1.0
"My philosophy as a manager is to first and foremost focus on my direct reports, goals and initiatives when it comes to their career or personal life. I'm there to support what they're working towards. With that, I expect my direct reports to tell me what they want to do with their career. I do not provide that for them. I will help guide them to maybe explore and decide what those initiatives and growth goals might be, but I will not make that decision for them because that is ultimately. Their goal and what they want to do. I want them to have the freedom to decide what that is, whether that be growth in my department, in my D company, in my company or elsewhere. I want to be the best support for them that I can be.",5.0
"My team is comprised of several different. Levels of expertise. We have our analyst. We have, uh, managing a manager of data and analytics. I myself am a manager of data and analytics and then we have our Director of data and analytics. Everybody works together to achieve our goals and we all have different responsibilities in different levels of input towards these goals. For example, the analyst is really boots on the ground working to find the data and information that we need, extracting it from the platforms that we can, and cleaning it in a manner that can be useful direction. For what data to achieve, gather is given by myself and the other manager. The manager's work together. To determine what needs to be done on a day-to-day basis and how we can strategically plan for achieving the greater strategy and the greater vision that is provided to us by our director. We work together with our director and the client to determine what these goals should be and make sure that. We are. Working towards that North Star that the client wants, the director has the most. Direct contact with the client and owns that relationship the most. So they are the ones leading that charge.",
"My boss is less in the weeds with the day-to-day work and removes themselves from being bogged down in the issues that might be happening on that day-to-day basis, and is leading the department and working with the client to form a strategic vision. My boss is the one who owns the client relationship. And is ultimately, who has those difficult conversations with the client if needed and is at the end of the day. Who is held accountable for the success? Or failure of the work that we do. To achieve our goals with the client.",
"You have always been a great performer, delivering excellent work, staying on target with client deliverables, and I've noticed recently there has been, um, some changes and shifting and the way you've been working specifically, I have noticed that your deliverables. Have not been presented to the client in a timely manner or on target with the dates established. And you've had an increase in your. Or decrease in your positive ITI that the rest of the team has started to notice. So I want to talk about how I can help you. Navigate maybe some causes of this shift in your work and. Come up with some. Solutions on how we might make you enjoy the work you're doing while also. Getting back on track to where you're. Performance can be where I know that your performance can be and I think you know where your performance can be, but at the end of the day still making it meaningful work for you enjoyable work for you and ultimately help you work towards the goals that you want to achieve as well.",5.0
"OK everyone, our goal is to put this puzzle together. The fastest possible way we can. So the way I think we should go about this is dividing and owning specific areas and then bringing it all together to finish the full picture. So one person will take on picking out pieces that are have the tiger in it. One person will focus on collecting pieces that have the polar bear in it. One person will. Collect pieces that are the background only and then one the last person is going to collect edge pieces. Once you collect all your pieces, start putting them together to form your piece of the puzzle and then we will put them together at the end and fill in any outstanding pieces so that we can have the full picture.",5.0
"Alright, my plan for my team, um, let's talk about who is my team so I am a senior account manager and I report directly to a supervisor reports into a group director and um, reporting to me is an associate account manager and so she's my direct report and as her very first job and someone out of college, I think the plan that we've that I have for. For our team, our little team is a little bit unique because of her being fresh and new to the industry and so part of my plan includes lots of 1 on one training and mentoring. I think it's important to feel supported when you are new in a role to feel like you are reassured that you are doing well and have the opportunity to ask questions in a safe space. And so I, um, I do my best to act as a resource. Or that I think goal setting is also important for teams. That way you get to know more about what they would like to grow. You can help provide them opportunities to strengthen those things or get experience in those areas. And it's a great way to measure progress because time can fly by and before you know it, it can be hard to sometimes recognize how far you've come and so checking against goals that have been set is a great way to do that. And so I think because she's new rise stay little bit closer, um? To her than I would with employees who have greater experience, and so there's been a lot of tutorials, one-on-one learning, and um, kind of cross checking. Um projects and information before they go out from her. But it's been my plan is to continue to give her more space to work on her own, to think through things on her own and to take on more responsibility as she is ready. Um and so. As part of that, um, you know, going back to the goals, I think having a place to check progress is important. Checking in every three to six months in a pretty informal way and maybe 6 to 12 more formally, and being sure that the feedback is both kind and constructive. Um, you know, we want to ensure that they are aware what's going well, but also very tactile, actionable ways in which they can also improve. And I also like to request. Feedback on myself? What can I do to better support them? What can I do to be a better manager and to hear from them directly? And so that's my plan for my team?",2.0
"My management philosophy is that a manager is meant to act as a resource as a safe place for questions as a mentor to offer advice and guidance, and to be an example for the team. And so I believe that a manager should be very much approachable available. You should never be scary or overly authoritative. You should be someone who is seen as a trusted resource and. Um, with that your your team should feel comfortable asking questions coming to you for guidance and um and respect you for that. And so I believe that it's helpful to give room for growth to be a little bit hands off, but again, always available, always present. Never make them feel like they're alone, lost or guided unguarded.",3.0
"So my account team is made-up of four different individuals. There is, um, myself, a senior account manager, my boss, an account supervisor, and her boss, eh, Group account director, and and then, um, reporting directly to me on our team is our associate account manager and we have an excellent team. It's a very strong, very well oiled machine working team. Um, we trust each other. We work well together. We care about each other. And we care about the work product that we are creating. The team is very much eh, approachable and welcoming team. I feel like I can go to either of my bosses for guidance, for advice to bounce off, ideas to gut check and I don't feel judged like I'm bothering them. I feel very much supported and I I trust and I respect them and I definitely see them as my examples and how I want to be a manager and continue to help. Support the growth and learning and success of the associate account manager who reports to me. Um, she's very hungry to learn. She's very willing and excited and responsive. She isn't afraid to ask questions, and so because of that, I think we are seeing lots of growth on our team. Everyone is kind, everyone is respectful and we really have a great balance in a great groove. Going with what we've got. Everyone knows their responsibilities, but we also don't feel. Trapped in that there's room to raise your hand and stretch and do something more if you want and everyone is very supportive of that. So we've got an awesome team.",
"My boss is an account supervisor and she has a variety of roles. I think being in her position, she stretches up in quite a bit, but she also, um, you know, leans her her hand down to to me and to the associate account manager that I managed to help support our learning and growth along the way. So she really is such a connector on the team and does a lot to support us, but she isn't beyond, you know, mentoring and and managing. Myself and injuring my growth. She also, UM, has is responsible for the crime client relationship with more more mid level clients. She's responsible for helping to bring in new business on the team and to keep things working well with what we've got going. So she's a very important part of the team.",
"Hi there, I wanted to go ahead and do one of our routine checkins. I think it's been a couple months since we chatted last about, you know the goals that you had said earlier this year and the you know the the progress in the items you were hoping to to work on. And so let's just do an informal check in here, but I wanted to see how first, how, how you were feeling about everything. How are you feeling about the role? And, um, you know all the projects we have going on right now. Um? Yeah, would love to hear anything that I can do to better support you in in those projects and in your goals. Um? Yeah, but I, you know, I think we've we've been really busy. Things have been a bit crazy. I know there's been a bit more stress and pressure as of late. Um, and I think that, um, is reflecting a little bit and in the in the work product that we're seeing um, and so I want you to know that I'm here as a resource. If you feel overwhelmed, you know, talk to me, let me know what I can take off of your plate. What I can support you on. I'm here for that. Um, you know, if you have any questions, it's always please don't hesitate to ask. Um and um, you know anything else I can do to help make this? They get experience. We really value having you on our team. We appreciate all the work that you do and want to make sure that you're happy and feel like you're you're growing in being pushed in all the right ways, but not too far that it feels out of range and this is beyond you know what you feel comfortable with.

"Alright team it is just about go time. We are going to do an awesome job. Um in competing in this puzzle. Um, completing competition. But I think our best plan of attack is going to be to dividing. Conquer based on the the key elements of the puzzle. So would love to have um employee AMB if you can take kind of the polar bear you guys find the pieces that are white that looked like the bear. Start forming that piece 'cause that'll be an easy picture to visualize and to start. Building out employees C&D. You guys will tag team on the tiger Um, Start building out that tiger. Get all the pieces put together and I myself I'm going to start working on the border finding this quarter pieces.

"Hate my team. Um, I have four direct reports that work across different accounts. Um. Starting with Angela, who works with me on quick trip, she is a super laid back person. She really has been on her own on that account for a long time, so she takes. A lot of ownership in what she does. She has a tendency to and she gets her work done. Um and she is. She's very, very confident in what she has to say, which is great. My challenge with her sometimes she isn't. Necessary doesn't necessarily know as much as she would need two to make background decisions, so I'm trying to, you know, coming onto the team newer, figure out how to help and assist her without making her feel like I'm coming in and making decisions without her or pushing her out of the way. 'cause that's definitely not the case. Um, Bryce. Join my team last year. She is really great. She joined right out of school. Um, so a little bit more tentative on the decision she makes. It's been really awesome to see her grow in her voice and be able to make recommendations over the past. Year and also really just figure out her working style and what works for her. How making to do lists works for her and how best to engage with both me and other members on the team. So it's awesome to see that growth from her. Um, Maddie is newer. She joined in January. I believe she's a super organized person. She loves to make a list. Um, seeing her on board and how she learns and learning how to best assist her husband. Interesting for me, but also, you know great to have her on the team and I think helping her. And Bryce work together since she has braces. Senior Connections manager has been another thing that you know has helped me develop my skills, but it's really been great. They work together all really well. So it was an awesome team, built a walk into and I'm excited to continue to help them grow.",
"So my boss is role is to first and foremost support and mentor his direct reports. If there's anything we're needing to help us do our jobs that we don't currently have. Um, he serves as a resource hill review our plans and make sure that we're on the right path. Um, the second thing he does is really just provide overarching department process recommendations. If we're making any changes to the way the larger team does things, he's part of those. Conversations um and then third is just kind of getting larger opportunities for the agency and participating in new business. So providing that experience he has on the media side to do that so. That is what he does.",
"Alright, difficult conversations so. I think the first thing I would do is just sit down with them one-on-one, see if there's anything larger going on. Kind of see if this is maybe not linked to. Eh, frustration with the company, but maybe it has more to do with just anything else going on. If that's something they're wanting to share. If it's something they're not, you know? Maybe give them some help in context around who they can. Share that with an HR if they are needing additional time off for additional support from the company that they you know don't feel like. Is something that they can share with me as their manager and then just? I think having even going from there too. If they're having frustrations with the larger team and the company is it. Is it something we can fix? Is it something we can address? Is it or do they have a negative attitude because they feel like they're, you know, not being seen on the team or not being supported as they would want to be? Um, I think all of those are conversations you need to have just to be able to address their concerns from. More of a human place that this, you know you didn't do this one report, and that's in, well, that's terrible. I think understanding maybe why they didn't do it, or why it was late and how to address the kind of that behind the problem before just, you know, coming at someone with a list of things that they're doing incorrectly is probably better. Obviously that's still a conversation. You need to have, but you know, addressing how you can help them solve those problems. And if there's anything you as their manager can help support them in. To to fix some of those issues, I think arriving late is probably not something but like having work done late or anything like that. What can we do to help support you in getting there? Or is there something else that you know you that you maybe need to talk to HR about because you can't make it here on time? I think those conversations are really important just to make sure everyone on the team is working towards one goal.",3.0
"Alright, I would have one person do sort help, sort the pieces into edge pieces, polar bear pieces and tiger pieces and then have one person each take the edge pieces, put them together at the polar bear, put them together and the tiger. Put them together and put them all in there. So that's how I would do it. Um, then the person who helps sort of the pieces I would have help assist as needed to make sure that their everyone seeing kind of the larger picture and not just the pieces they're doing.",3.0

Um, I really want to find more opportunities for my team members to get in front of clients. Have those leadership roles that we all like to see them have. Um also would like to, you know, help to foster that environment where everyone's opinion is heard. Everyone's thoughts and ideas about the business can be heard because I really do feel like that leads to better work. It leads to better opportunities for everyone and. Um, something I'd like to continue working on that's currently happening. It's just everybody owning their own projects, looping people in as needed, and providing that additional context. I think we're in a really great place, but I would just like to see everybody take on their own roles and responsibilities for that, but also know when to ask for help that they can't ask for help. That it's definitely not only accepted, but um. You know recommended and championed. We want everyone to feel like they have the opportunity to. Learn and um. Not getting over their heads and have that support when they want it. So I'm really hopeful that that's what we'll see in the next six months to a year.",3.0

The challenge of. Making sure that I'm as available as I need to be, and providing that assistance when people need it. My goal is to make everyone feel empowered to make those decisions on their own, and but also feel like they have a helping hand there when they need it.

He understands the technology landscape of his accounts to a really deep level and also can manage and lead a project into completion. And so that's how I would describe our teams roles.",
"My leadership or management philosophy is all built around the idea of being a servant leader. Leading by example, not being someone who sits atop. The pyramid and points down to the team members and tells them what to do. Rather, someone who was at the front of the line showing the leading by example being an active part of the team and the goals that were working to accomplish, and that servant leadership is something that I've developed over my years of looking at and understanding the different types of leaders in our industry in our company and beyond, right? I really do believe that you can't micromanage. Or dictate something to someone and not give them the opportunity to understand or to ask questions right? And so I also as a leader, strive to not be a micro manager and to give my team autonomy. And those are my leadership philosophes.",6.0
"My plan for my team has multiple aspects that focus on different areas of growth and opportunity that I see for the team members that I manage. Specifically. One area of opportunity for my team that I manage is around delegation of tasks and clear understanding of ownership of responsibility. Historically on our team. We have had a more group approach to tackling problems and projects and there haven't been clear assignments of who was working on which aspect of the work, and that's because we move so quickly and have our priorities change so often that we kind of have to group together and attack a problem as a team. But many of the team members, a few of the team members, at least on the team, have identified to me that they need more structure and more direction. In order to bring our visions to life, so for my inclusion experience team, one of my goals is to. Be the facilitator or the middleman for our executive leaders vision. And the team that brings that vision to life. So I'll synthesize the vision or hear the vision from our executive leader understand what his goals are and what his needs are for this project and for his vision. And then I'll work with my team to make sure that they wanna understand the vision and to understand what their part is in bringing that vision to life. So that is one of my goals for my team. Another goal for my team would be. Development professional development. I have, ah, I'm lucky to have a incredibly smart team of people that I manage and. They could be future stars of this company or of any company, and one of my goals is to coach them, to mentor them, to work with them, to give them the opportunities to try new things to grow their skill sets, to reach their own goals, because I feel that it's a manager's duty to understand the needs of your team, both from a professional development standpoint in otherwise and actively help them work towards achieving those goals. So I want to be. Someone who is seen as a manager that builds their team up that gives their team members the opportunity to shine that really cares about the needs and wants and goals of the people that they manage and really strives to help them achieve those goals. So those are the two top level plans or goals that I have for the team that I manage.",5.0
"As a creative director at the UM INR, my plan for my team, especially for working on the US Navy account, is to inspire the creatives that work for me to take control of their own careers and to begin taking on more responsibility so they can grow as creatives. And there are five pieces I'd like to do to encourage that among my team and the first one is to provide. Always provide support when there are questions that arise. You know I want to be available to my team whenever they have something that they don't understand and I want to feel like they can come to me with any question or concern that they have because my job as a manager to make sure they have that those resources. The second thing I want to make sure I do for them is to also provide clear direction for and ask so whatever the project is that they're working on, I want to make sure I'm giving them all the tools and resources they require. To ensure that they are able to get the job done to the best of their ability. The third thing I try to do as a manager is to make sure that their personal needs are also met, so if they need a day off if they're overworked. If they don't feel like they can be their best selves everyday, I want to make sure that they're taking the time they need to rest and recharge because nobody can be 100% all the time. The fourth piece I try to do as a manager and my plan for them is to make sure that I celebrate their contributions because by positive reinforcement, I believe that people can become better at what they do then by consistent negative reinforcement. And then the fifth thing I try to do as a manager is as they grow, continue to delegate more responsibilities to my team so they can in turn become eventually become managers and see. What it takes to actually accomplish a leadership role? It's not. Telling somebody what to do or being their boss, but guiding them through the process so they can gain the confidence they need to one take on projects on their own. And two um, begin to earn some of those trust and responsibilities that come with doing the job right and doing the job. Well, those are my overarching goals for trying to be a manager. I hope to gain a little bit more knowledge through his process, um? Thank you very much.",5.0
"My management philosophy is to leave by positive example, so I would never want my team to put my team in a situation that I wouldn't put my team in myself, or isn't something that I have experience as a um. As a younger person working in that field so as, uh, someone who came up as a copywriter, I want to make sure that I am giving my team the resources that they need to get the job done well. And that may mean myself stepping in to help if they are not feeling like they have what they need to help with that as well. Um, I also believe in leading with positive ITI, so I've had managers in the past who have led with fear and I don't believe that's the best way to get the motivation. What you need out of your people? I think the best way to lead is through excitement and positive ITI and rewarding people for doing a good job in doing and having a job well done.",4.0
"So I have a very young team, you know, most of the people that I have on my team are right out of school, um or are just a couple years into the industry, so they're all in their 20s and they're all learning the process of how advertising works. So that being said, when I. I'm working on a project. I may need a little extra help or a little extra time to guide them to know the right way to do their job just because they don't. They may not have the experience that other teams have. I have two people that are right out of school that are learning a very, very complicated brand, yet are being expected to operate completely independently. That means I need a little bit more time to guide them in the process then I would with the rest of my. The three other folks on my team who have been working for me for three or four years. It takes a little bit longer to explain, and I wish some of our teammates understood the difference between someone that was right out of school and someone that might have a little bit more experience because. It makes quite a difference in terms of the management process, so I can expect those people with a little more experienced to have better leadership and time management skills. Then I would somebody who's right out of college and this may be their first job, and that's just the nature of the business that we work on and the type of candidates that enrolls we need to fill. But it does make actually leading them a little bit more challenging because. That means more time out of my day directing and guiding, so I would just ask that we keep that in mind when we are assigning projects to each of the team members.",
"Um, as my my role is the creative director at the company, but my boss is role is the executive Creative Director and his job is to ensure that all creative work that we create for specifically my account, the US Navy account is meeting the standards necessary to make it one of the world class accounts that we have at the at the company. So we I work with him on pushing the creative work, making sure the review process is going smoothly. And then also when there are problems that arise, I can reach out to him to talk to his senior leadership team to help erase some of those issues. Um, his other role is to make sure we inspire younger creatives to learn the business and to give them opportunities. May be outside of, um, what we're doing on the US Navy account to become better creatives and do world class work.",
"So normally I would ask you how you think your progress has been going. Um, but today since we've already talked about that, I'd like to talk to you about the three things I've picked up on lately about your performance. First, I've noticed that work has been coming in late, and I want to give you an example of a project that came in late and the reason why, and I would love to hear from you why that project was late what? Um? Why that project was late and what you think the issue was that held you up there. The second thing I've noticed is projects have come in sloppy. There are typos, there are errors. There are things that take time out of my day to go in and fix because you're not taking the time to pay attention to them. And I want to ask you what you think you can do to improve some of the sloppiness that's been going on lately. If you need extra time. Love for you to come to me and say, hey I need an extra 2 hours just to do some proofreading so I can make sure things are correct. The third thing I've noticed is your attitude, so I'm used to a person who jumps at the chance to get the job done, but lately I've noticed there's a little bit of an adjustment that needs to be made. There's some. Frustrations that I've heard from other team members about, um, you're the way you're looking at projects and, um, you know when they ask when they make a request of you, I would love to find out from you what's going on and if not, we're going to have to talk about expectations and what your future at the company looks like because I can't have a non team player on my team who isn't willing to adjust. So let's. Build a project plan for you that addresses these three things specifically, and then we can check in again in six weeks and see how you've done.",5.0
"So in order to get this puzzle done, the best thing we can do is to delegate in this process and each one of us is going to decide is going to take on a specific piece. So one person is going to do the corners. We gotta find the four corners of the puzzle and put it together. That's what's going to help guide the shape. The second person is going to build the polar bear, so one of you is going to build the polar bear. The third person is going to search for the tiger pieces and the 4th person. Is going to search for the outline pieces. Everything that goes along the edges that builds the sides of the puzzle. I am here to help you sort pieces, so if you want me to dig through the big pile and pull out some of the polar bear pieces to sort net section or to dig through the pile and look for the corner pieces with you, let me know and I'm able to hop in and help each one of you do your task most efficiently to get the job done.",4.0
"I think with my team I have four employees. One is a senior connections Manager, 2 or connections managers and then one just started as an associate connections manager. Um, the Associ connection manager is the newest of the team. They've only been here a couple weeks. And then the two connections managers in the senior had been here about a year, which has been really nice about a perfect amount of time to get comfortable with the client and the team that we're working on and really start stepping up into their own, uh, the reason we brought an associate connections manager on was so that we could replace senior connection manager had left I really saw the opportunity to backfill this position with someone a little bit more junior to allow my team opportunity to kind of grow into the next step of their careers. And that being said. You know my plan for my team. Is a little bit of our plan for the team. I think I've tried to really take into account the trajectory they want their careers to grow in the direction that they reach. Kind of stepping into as well as their strengths. Um, obviously those things don't come without, you know, sometimes harder days or some of their weaknesses. But trying to balance the workloads they're doing with certain people strengths with other peoples. Maybe weaknesses has been really beneficial with the people that we've hired in the team that we have. And so you know, my plan for the team. The I'm at a crossroads now, personally where I'm trying to grow my career beyond just being their manager and running this account, but more so focused on making sure that you know day-to-day, my success is now kind of on the shoulders of their success and hoping that they continue to stay fulfilled with work and happy with work they're doing and also challenged me and pushed in a direction so. Oliver back story, I think to say that you know my plan is to continue to elevate them within their roles. Help them feel more confident in the work they're doing, help them feel confident to take on more work, and do that comfortably knowing that they have me to lean on when they need to, so that not only it helps them grow and that they can still feel fulfilled, but also it gives me the opportunity to continue to step up into a more management focused role.",4.0
"My management philosophy is a combination, I think of two pillars, one mutual respect and the other is accountability and so you know, even though I am the supervisor on the account and my title is technically higher and I am running all of the work of the account and you know their their boss. We all are equals. We all have a job to do. We all come to work to do that job and so my philosophy starts at the foundation of making sure that they know that I am not better than them just because of my title. We're here to do a job together at the same time, and I hope that as their manager I can kind of be there support system and their guidance through their career and then the second-half of my manager philosophes. Also the accountability piece where when something goes wrong, it's not only about making sure we're correcting that behavior, but they feel confident and comfortable to be able to come to me, have a conversation about it so we can come to a solution. Together and so that it doesn't become a surprise down the road.",5.0
"Um, my team is incredible. I feel so honored to get to work with each of them everyday. I know we worked hard to find good people to bring onto the team and from honestly their interview. Until now I've just been estatic with their performance. Starting with Matt, you know he stepped in on the team and really filled a role that we needed him to fill in a time that we needed someone to be able to speak to clients and eloquently explained the work we're doing and also be able to handle questions on the fly. With the knowledge he has in the industry and he's done that and so much more, he stepped up into such strong strategic roles on the team. He's also really helped to mentor and assist some of our younger team members and learning the ropes of Google ads, then step to Andrew and Jordan. They both kind of started around the same time and have just flourished. They both had minimal amounts of paid search experience and for being their first jobs as connections managers and first time buying paid search. You know they haven't their. Their positions haven't come without mistakes, but we have been able to build a relationship where they can feel confident in the work they're doing. They can also feel confident asking questions, making sure that if they need to go check something they can, but they also know that if I'm giving feedback, it's not coming from a place of belittling them. It's coming from a place of wanting them to succeed, and we've been able to build that, and so you know, they all are so strong in their communication skills, their ability to explain the job, and then also just their technical expertise. I feel on her just to get to work with them every day. They make this job very easy and then I think. Lastly, with Natalie right. She's been here three weeks but she has just shown such strength and being able to pick up something and run with it and asks so many good questions that this team just excites me to get to be a manager and to work alongside each of them everyday.",
"I feel blessed to say that I not only have a boss that I report to, but also I feel like I have a lot of mentors and bosses, but Valerie Shashi is my manager. Her role is the leader of the paid search department and then her bosses Heather Physioc and her role is also the leader of the Discover Ability Team, and I feel like both of their roles are in parallel, and it's something that I aspire to be in a leader, but Valerie specifically, she is there for some of the day-to-day crunch. She's there to help put out fires when things need to happen. She's there for accountability, but also to make sure that our team feels supported. I think I've witnessed for a lot of people that she's also there has a shoulder when you need that to have that hard conversation, but also there to hold you accountable and make sure that you're doing the best work that you could possibly do with all of the changes that have happened to our team in the last year. I think she has done such a strong job of being able to kind of carve out her role and maintain her sanity while also making sure everyone else feels balanced with their future careers.",
"I think I would begin the conversation casually, trying to make sure that they feel comfortable and confident. Ask them about their day, asked how they're feeling, and then slowly segue that or maybe bluntly have to segue that into work and say there's something I think I want to suffer it discussed today. It's probably not going to be an easy conversation, but please bear with me. I am not, you know, there's always a path forward that we can figure out together and then give them the feedback. Make sure that it try not to sandwich it too much with positive ITI. Make sure that it's direct. But also deliver it compassionately because that's also important. So for example, instead of just saying you're underperforming, say I've noticed over the last two months that we're starting to see some consistency. The inconsistencies with maybe missing deadlines or whatever that might be. Try to be compassionate and how you frame it, but also not sugarcoating that it's not a serious issue, so giving that then that feedback, making sure you're set-up there and then work with them to listen to what their opinions are on that pushed them. Maybe on trying to understand why. They think that these things are happening, if hopefully it's not a surprise, but if it is a surprise to them helping them have that conversation. Continuing to facilitate that conversation beyond, and then also very explicitly focusing on what our action plan is and what steps we're going to take to try to make things better. So ideally I think transparently I would want this conversation to happen before two months into this issue if it were my direct report, but at the same time, if that's the position that we're in, and this is the feedback I had to give. Um, I think it's a lot about compassion, accountability, and making sure that you're giving them direct, actionable things that not necessarily only I align with, but also that they understand and agree with and then continue to follow up consistently with them. So if it's continued issue making sure we set it, we agree on something and then continuing to check in with them to make sure we're moving towards those, and that it's not going to escalate into an even further issue.",4.0

Let's also then focus on trying to find what similar colored ones we can do together where we can collaborate. Let's do that. And then let's focus on a task that we can each accomplish things we can work on. If you see something that someone else can help with, make sure you're passing that piece over to them, right? Broccoli communicated, hey, is anyone see a white piece? Then maybe we missed in the sorting, but I think the important piece. Years, let's get organized. First, let's kind of not quickly, but efficiently put together a plan to make sure we all know what we're working on and why. Get that outside put together, then work on the inside pieces.

"Good morning, I believe being a great manager is also part of being a great leader. Being open, honest, being communicative. Um handholding if needed, constructive criticism in order to be a great leader you have to give great feedback. There needs to be workforce optimization. Collaboration is beyond important. It's not about a manager just giving all of the tools and directions out, but also listening to the needs of the individual that reports into you. Performance management is important and also helping them to grow the skills. It's not about just being a greater what you do, but it's also about being graded who you are. You can't just be a leader and be. Amazing at the work that you do, but also be a great individual. People need to be able to communicate with you and feel comfortable and coming to you to discuss things and issues and situations. But also in being a great manager and a leader, learning the needs of the individuals that reporting to you, everybody has different learning styles, learning tools, what they need to succeed. The way they learn maybe differently. Someone may need information up front. All of the information, and that's how they move forward. Others may need a few pieces of information at a time before they can get everything that they need.

But at the same time not making them feel like they can't navigate the space that they need to be successful and the role that they're in. Um, you have to figure out what your approach is. You have to figure out how to be a leader that to properly make the appropriate decisions.

Um, there are two individuals that currently report into me, which is a small unit as I was used to four, but things shift, so we have a coordinator. Or should I call her a talent specialist? She is responsible for a few things so. Scheduling interviews to make sure that we are meeting with the individuals that we probably need to meet with. For open roles. She is also scheduling interviews for. Hiring managers and for individuals on those specific client teams that need to meet with candidates, she helps with reference checks and background checks and anything in between. Even sending out offer letters and additional benefits paperwork which helps us continue to do the things that we need to do to find the candidates. But I have a senior recruiter that reports into me and she has her assignments and so typically those are more entry level roles to mid level roles. In some some senior roles if needed, but finding that proper talent and trying to keep a part, uh, pipeline, and maybe what the benchmark strategy looks like and helping me to properly build those those candidates for the roles that are open. And then I am a manager who overseas everyone, but I make sure that I'm high. Um, that I'm filling the higher level roles and navigating that space, but then also making sure that everybody. Work is a lot accordingly and no one is overworked. No one is stretched thin and trying to figure out where things can be moved around if need be.",
"My boss is Kimberly Spencer. She is a group director of talent acquisition across North America. She has about.

"In speaking with an employee that has gotten off track, possibly an employee that has been doing a great job and things have shifted. Um, lateness being negative, not being approachable, just completely not understanding or losing focus on what is happening. So just having that conversation around. I'm noticing things have shifted. I noticed that you aren't 100% focused or or dedicated to the role. Um, how are you? How are things? How is life? Is there something that I can help you with? Is it something that I can help you navigate that is differently, and sometimes it could be a a mental health space or break and sometimes you have to be all the time. You have to be ready and willing to accommodate them. It could be a. Day that they need it could be a couple days. I'm just in talking with them to see what the challenges are that have caused the shift as it's something in the home life is it work? Is there too much work on their plate? Are they stretched thin and going back to the space of um? Maybe helping them navigate team roles because they have too much work on their plate, but then offering up suggestions to help them figure out how to move forward? And now would not be stuck in that space where they are not showing up appropriately for work to do the task at hand, and the roles that they are assigned to do. Um, sometimes they just may may need a little hand holding and then other times it can be larger than that. So as a manager talking to an employee that reports into them, how can I help you?

Good sound, sharp communication skills and to be able to communicate with the clients to be able to communicate internally with team members with a lot of different communication styles. So as a CE lead? Um, it's very important to have sharp communication skills, yes, but then also to be able to flex and adapt to different different styles of communicating. So I'd say my plan for the team is definitely to have strong communication skills when it comes to delivering on those those needs. Also, a strong sense of, um, prioritizing needs as well. So a lot of times, you know there's there's asks that multiple asks that will come our way in in in all different shapes and forms in multiple directions. And so my plan for the team is to for them to be able to not only just look and digest those asks and think about them in a strategic way, but also to prioritize them as they deliver on it. Um. And then also my plan for the team. As two is to be kind to one another and to have a good time, you know we all got into advertising because it's it's fun. It's not math. Um, we get to work with a lot of different folks with a lot of different backgrounds and stories, and that's what we love. And that's what we're good at. And so making sure that we also keep that top of mind and share when it feels OK. Share a little bit of your story, and and then. Also help others feel comfortable in sharing theirs. And um, what else? Let's see other just plans for for the team, I'd say, um. Of course, like I feel like we're all we're all we have to be like pro jugglers where where we have to be good at juggling a lot of different balls, and we have a lot of different balls in the air constantly, so making sure again it goes back to, you know, having communication and and being able to prioritize, just having that right mindset to be to be able to juggle those walls.",1.0
"My management philosophy is to empower my direct reports in in them becoming in honing in on skills that feel, um, right for them and empower them to become the the great see lead that I just talked about in my previous video, where you're able to communicate. You're able to be kind and you're able to. Work with with different types and styles of people. And, um, I'd say. My my one philosophy is definitely too to work with them on. You know what feels right to them and and to hone in on the skills of the field that feel right. But then also help them grow and learn and build. I. I remember when I was an intern and and now where I'm at it's it's crazy. I'd call it a hike. It's been a crazy high. Can you learn so much so to be able to give them the right context and perspective is key. That's that's very important, so I'd say. Overall.",2.0

"My management philosophy is always be growing. Um, I think it's important for an individual to when they start to be better as a employee and as a person, um, when they. From when they start to when they finish, so it's very important to me to figure out how I can help a team member grow. Um, is it giving them harder tasks? Is it, um, helping them a little bit more than I would someone else? It is? Is it giving them space for them to figure out um, issues on their own? Um, is it pulling someone else in who might be more of an expert on something that? I am so I think that it's very important as a manager for me to help team members grow. That's my philosophy.",1.0

She's in an immigrant and I think that that bodes well for her because she comes in. She gets things done. Um she. Um is definitely a go getter and she always wants more tasks like I'm gonna do this thing exactly this way and then look at it great. What's my next thing? So it's so easy to manage her. Um, Brighton is um, is young Brighton and Gabriel are both very young in their work lives. None of my team members have worked. Um, in the area that they're working in now, so they're new to this particular. Type of job. But like I said, Tina is well seasoned. Um, in doing a lot of awesome stuff. Um, Brighton. Is so is so cool, he's very easygoing. Um, and he is a task like if you give him a task, you don't have to hold his hand. He's very good at running with it and figuring it out and also very good at taking feedback. And I think that it's very important. Um, as a team member to be able to take feedback. Well, um, and then use it to get better. And then Gabriel is extremely. Um, bright and sunny, and she's just a kind of a ball of energy, and I think that that helps any team to have kind of a energetic center.

"Uh, my plan for my team is to empower them to be as successful as possible. Um, I think you know, um, knocking down doors or barriers for them, getting whatever information they need in order to do their job. Um, and then giving them space and grace to be able to do that job. I I would never want to be a micro manager 'cause I know how it feels when, um, the person. Who is in charge of you? You feel like they don't trust you or they don't think that they that you can do your job. So I think that it's important to empower success. Um, the second thing I would want to provide for my team as a manager is, um, the ability to. Help them grow. So whatever um spots or or gaps they have and knowledge, um, in their own leadership skills and any of that stuff, I think that it would be in my best interest to help them grow because the better the team member is, the better the team is. So anything that I can do to help them grow within their skill set um within their their management skill set. And then within their person, person tude, if that's even a word within the company, I think that that is definitely something that it would be important for me and then lasts. I think it would be important um or what I want to give to my team as a manager is like a shield. Um, a lot of times when you're on a team there are certain things that you do. That people try to take more of your time then they should not only do they try to take more of your time, they also try to take um, like or blame you for something or do any of those things.

So the first part would would to be like. Identify what the problem is, and then the second part of that is to see if there's anything that I can do. Um, 1st is my the management style that I'm using with you. Is it not working for you? Um, is there something here that's happening that is making you uncomfortable? Um, is the company not supporting you in some aspect and then the third part would be to figure out if there's something going on with that particular. Individual so um, are you like? Is there something going on at home? Um, is there something that's going on with, um, you know, personally, um, you know, is it your your living situation?

But if you see something that works at a different area, just hand it over and say hey this goes there that way that we can make sure that we're working together as a team and not working on the same parts at the same time.

"So my plan for my team, um, I'm a new manager and have only had a direct report for a few months so my team is in the very beginning building stages. Um, so my first sort of steps, um, I think is to really get organized and to have a deep understanding about what my direct reports are working on, and the best ways to support. Them and set-up a system using the tools within our agency. Um, to make sure that I sort of always know what's going on. And, um, best setup to support them. However they might need. Um, just so I'm not completely out of the loop. Um, I just want them to feel like I'm there without feeling overbearing like I'm there. So that would be sort of stuck one, I think within the plan, um, and then I'd also like to set-up really strong development and learning plans for my direct reports just to make sure that they have a really clear understanding about their career path within. Our company, UM and. Also, so that I have a clear understanding about what they're looking to have as part of their career, the goals that they are hoping to achieve, um. I feel like a really strong sense of responsibility towards my direct reports, especially from a career development perspective. Um? Beyond that, um, because I haven't had a direct report for very long. Um, I would need to have a better understanding about how to elevate my team within the company and get them as many opportunities as possible, and I think sort of that part of the plan might come with. Time, um, and definitely wouldn't be something that's right away. Both my direct report I have now and the new one I have coming or both brand new hires, so it's a little bit of like orientation. I think 1st and then setting them up for success long term within the company if that's where they choose to remain and stay. Um? Yeah, I think I think that would be the plan from the very beginning and I think that plan would change and evolve over time. At least I hope that it would, um, as my direct reports grow within their own role and within their own skill set. Um, my plan would be to set things up in a way that was very agile and could help them achieve success.",1.0
"My management philosophy. Um, I think is several different aspects. One would be, um, I feel like a manager should be someone who is very. Um, supportive of their direct reports, who is a resource but also not someone who's going to solve every problem, but someone who can help enable their direct reports to, um, kind of solve some of their own problems, like help them figure out solutions on their own. Um, I don't think um, manager should be the one to. Just come in and save the day because I don't feel like that would set-up direct reports for success in their own growth and their ability to make their own decisions. So I do think a manager or someone who is like a good resource can be sort of like a good backbone and support when there's external pressure to a team.

"My team, my one direct report. Um, I think is someone who could really benefit from mentorship within the company. Um, I can see that he has some. Of the like basic skills to fulfill the role and he has pretty decent presentation skills, but I do feel like he needs some additional training and potentially a mentor. A mentor within the agency I think is something that he's asked for, but also could really benefit from just some additional guidance on the best sort of ways to approach thing and to help him build his, um, philosophy about. The area of work that that were in UM. He definitely needs some work in those areas. I think his background the companies come from before he his Roldan encompass all of the things that he's doing now so he just did part of those things so he's not used to. Doing things like building reports, um, but he is used to the data, which is an important part of it, but I think he definitely could use some like story building help and sort of building up um, the final product for the client, but I do feel like he has pretty strong presentation skills and you can tell he has really spent time with the data and dug in really well, but definitely feel like he could use some.

The same challenges that that we used to we are an audio visual production team, so I want them to learn how to be involved in every stage of the production, not only thinking in the exciting excitement of that that TV production, but being more being more involved in the digital, um deliveries and one another point that I want to. Who growth with them is spending more time together, because now with the with the pandemic situation we are not spending time as a team and I think we should gather, uh, at least one or two times in the week.

"Hello, my name is Sarah Harden and I currently have one direct report. Um he is the. Senior accountant staff accountant kind of role. Um he does a multitude of different things right now and I've only been a manager for going on almost 12 months, so I don't really have a set plan for him yet. We're still working out those details and kind of what we're going to do next, but I do have some goals for him. Um, he's picked things up very quickly. He really aggressive things. On the first or second try and so the path that I would have for him would be to get better at the things that he's been doing and then kind of look at the future to see what would be good next for him to do to kind of build his path, his career path, and kind of where he wants to go within the organization. My hope is that maybe within the next six months or so that he'll be able to move up to the senior level when we brought him in originally. That was what we wanted to do. But change that a little bit with the needs on the team and the sides of the team. So we started him out with just the staff accountant level so he can get familiar with the industry since he had not worked in the industry before and get him familiar with our timing and deadlines and things like that and he's done very, very well. So in the coming months I would like to pass a few more things off to him and then give him a few more tasks to kind of start. Getting down that are a little bit more advanced, and once he conquers those, maybe it has 12 month mark or more like 18 month Mark will be able to re evaluate kind of see his progress and see what he's ready to take on or if he's ready to move to that senior level, um. He, I think, is very interested in that we've had conversations. I tried to meet with him regularly to discuss and see what his path is, where he wants to go and and make sure that the plans that I have for him or also what he wants to do, and to make sure that he is on board with that and that. That's what he likes to do. So that's all I have. Thanks.",2.0

Or what different styles are. And so I want to be like the managers that have made it easy for me. I pretty much just feel like if you get your work done and you do it with accuracy, that you you are good. I don't feel like I need to. Put my thumb on you, so to speak or micro manage. I know some people need that, but I prefer not to manage that way and I prefer to just ask my people. How do you like to be managed? How much of my attention do you need and do it that way. But for the most part, I'm pretty hands off and just prefer for everyone to do what they know they're supposed to do and just get their stuff done.",6.0
"So if I were talking to senior management about coal, which is my one direct report, I would. Say that he does a great job. He is not as good about taking notes and writing things down. He still asks a lot of questions even after almost being here for a year and I think he just relies on me a lot to help him with what he needs to do versus taking the initiative to figure that out on his own and he doesn't really take the time to. Record something or, you know, build training documents where he can do things for himself or get comfortable with researching something himself. If he's not really sure where to go to get the answer. Instead he just comes to me and asks me. And deadlines are he runs a pretty tight with those. Deadlines are good, but I think he could use a little work there. I do think he makes a good effort to try to make those deadlines as close as he possibly can, but I think sometimes his time management is a struggle a little bit and maybe he doesn't spend as much time focusing on the things that he needs to when he needs to, but otherwise I feel like he knows what's expected of him and knows what it should be done and he's able to accomplish that. Most month ends when we're really busy. He's able to do those tasks and. That's when we're in a scramble and trying to get everything done so everyones time is very limited and he does really well every month. He in the beginning he needed help but now we're getting to a point to where he's getting better about knowing what he needs to do without help. But I still think he does rely on me quite a bit for questions and how to get through things instead of thinking for himself and trying to figure that out.",

Does that include adding limited partnership interest in the general account and getting some exposure to alternative alpha? Are you also looking at and identifying opportunities in the insurance dedicated fund space? And I I assume that you're probably also looking at that from your reinsurance business and ways that you can leverage that in reinsurance trust? Well, that's good 'cause that that pretty much aligns with what we're seeing with your peers in the marketplace and specifically ways that the bank has been able to differentiate some of the services that we provide to insurance companies like yours. Yeah. Part of what we've been able to do is help navigate the different fund structures, the different um trust structures and ways to ultimately leverage some of the new regulatory changes that have happened. Part of that is, is just going through and understanding the types of investments that that your insurance company is comfortable with and then ultimately how we can help service those assets and actually make sure that they fit into the regulatory and the operational construct of the entities that you're working with. Yeah. We built out of business that specifically helps service the alternative assets. And part of what we're trying to do is make sure that our clients can leverage that to the best of their ability. And at the end of the day, we help them extend what they need to be able to do because it's all about creating alpha either in the general account or in the reinsurance space as well.

"We've noticed that the retention of focus of our teams has been waning. Part of that we think is we believe it's the stress of the business and with COVID and the other things, it's pushed some of our teams. Stress limits to the limit, I should say, um, we need to give her team the ability to decompress and get away so they can recharge their batteries. We also need to remain competitive with our competitors in the market as they are offering this perk. I really think one of the ways that we can we can help alleviate this is by offering up an additional week of paid leave. It would give them a chance to really disconnect, recharge the batteries, get focused again and ultimately provide better service to us and to our clients, which is the key focus. Um, I've noticed that a lot of our teams. You know they're on at 6:30 in the morning and they don't sign off until 10 at night, but the stress has just gotten too high even though they're working remote. Doing the remote thing is a challenge, and this is a great way that we could show them that we are concerned about them. And we want to and were concerned about their well-being.",5.0

Most of those employees would say that the second week is really where they truly get to decompress and disconnect from the office. It's not that we need to mandate this additional week, but that we should highly suggest that employees really need this time, need to take this time off. As managers, we need to understand how important this is to their well-being and how it ultimately improves their productivity. If we don't address this, there's a higher probability that we lose the employees or they end up dealing with emotional problems down the road, both of which hurt our business and our productivity. We need to make sure that these employees feel that they can step away when they need to. Because if they don't, then like I said, it hurts our business and that's not a good thing.",5.0

You know what your reporting needs are, how many alternative investment managers you have, how you're processing capital column distribution activity now, are there any shortfalls in your reporting? Do you need more analytics?

So we have a front to back office solution with dead aggregation that will roll everything up and report out for you. Um. On a on a higher, higher level or we can get to the granular level and report out on your individual managers.

And we can take out all of the other, um, elements that we talked about today so that we're just focusing in what it is that you need and that's alternative investments.",3.0
"So I wanted to talk to you a little bit about paid time off holiday time per our emails. Um. You know, I I think it's a good idea, and This is why I think it's a good idea. Um. I think our industry is changing and it's more. Dynamic and evolving overtime because of the pandemic, um in our industry, whatever it can give us a competitive edge as far as retaining good talent. Um think we need to do that. I think extending an extra week of paid time will show that. Where in it we support our employees, and I think that will be able to retain good talent by doing so. I know that we'd be we already are a leader in the industry. I know there's an expense side to this, and I get it, but I think it does fall within our budget. Um, based on the feedback that we're hearing from the younger generation, it's something that everyone wants. And if we don't provide it, we may lose good talent and we don't want to lose that young talent. So I support it. I understand the expense side, but I think that we do have enough in budget to get by that. What are your thoughts?",3.0
"Well, I'm glad that you're receptive to it. Um, I tell you what I think. There's some data to support this, right? So I did some hallmark. Over the last two weeks I've pulled together our top three competitors, Northern Trust State, St, BNY Mellon. I I took a look to see what they're doing for paid holidays and vacations. It does look like 2 out of the three with JP Morgan being the outlier that the other two are already doing it. So I think in order to keep up with industry standards, it would be in our best interest to. To go ahead and incorporate the paid holiday leave, um also have some data that supports retention over there and it shows that since this was rolled out to their employees, the percentage of retention has increased pretty dramatically over the last three years. So I think that the data is with us. I think that it's something that we should strongly consider. And thanks again for listening to me today on this very important initiative.",3.0

And I think to an extent, I think we would be successful in getting that as well. And uh, yeah, I think she's pretty convinced. And we were discussing this last week when I was away.

It really is wonderful and the coast is beautiful out there. Absolutely, yeah. No, that's great. Well, well, thanks. Thanks again for making the time. Really appreciate it. It's great to meet you. And um, you know, looking forward to going through this process video. Um, I guess, could you tell me a little bit about, you know, why you're considering moving your alts and you know what your current state is? Yep. That's great. No, that that that makes a lot of sense and you know, certainly understand those pain points and you know would really be happy to help. So what can I tell you about being my melon and, you know, that would be helpful to your process. Sure. So I'll give a little bit of background here. So be in my melon.",3.0
"So let me tell you a little bit about being my melon and sort of how we think about alts. So first of all, we have a number of clients who are insurance companies around your size, who we offer alternative investment services for. Some examples are New York life and in San Francisco life, also Colorado life. They've all been clients for a long time and we have great relationships with them. Some of the services that we offer are really bespoke around alternatives. So we really focus on derivatives. I'm processing those derivatives of, you know, making our data available to our clients so that the front office can access it and work with it and really run analytics on it on a daily basis. So, you know, one of the strengths that we have is, you know, not only our data and our services, but also the relationships we have with our clients. So we haven't opened our policy. We like to get out and see you visit, you make sure that our services is meeting your needs and that we're delivering the best. Outcomes possible for your company, so certainly would be great to have you connect with some of our clients and hear how they're using us today.",3.0
"So just to share a little bit more background about BNY Mellon, we are actually the largest custodian in the world with 45 trillion assets under custody. So if you really think about all of the assets in the world globally, that's 20% of assets globally and we really have projections to be at 30% by 2030. So that's pretty remarkable. You know we are trusted by that entire group of. Largest we we, we are, we are, we are trusted.",3.0
"So thanks for the feedback on, on the value proposition. Um, you know, could I just ask, you know, is there anything in particular, um that that seems confusing? I certainly want to be able to help and make sure that you're really comfortable and, you know, completely comfortable with the value prop and in what we can offer for you. OK, sure. That makes sense. So let me break it down. Um, you know really into two pieces. Um, first of all you know the the service and people and second while the product, right. So from a service and people perspective, we hire the best folks in the industry. Our teams are fantastic. You will have White glove client service from start to finish each day. If you ever need anything escalated, we will be there and respond within a Nestle of 12 hours. Um, second ball. From a product perspective, we have award-winning products in our ALT product is lauded as really the best in the industry. Um, you know, as you know, we have over 45 trillion assets under custody, 20% of the world's global assets, and that really is testament to both our product and our people.",4.0
"So yeah thanks for making the time. I I wanted to just you know sit down and really talk about our leave policy. Um it's it's really generous as is in our employees have been working really hard and I think what we're hearing internally it you know it is rumblings of both change in the industry and you know also change in how we work in and work patterns. So I really just wanted to kind of get your opinion on how you think it's working and where you think we should go from here. Sure. Yeah. No, that makes sense. And you know I I completely understand. I mean what what we're up against in some cases is these policies of unlimited vacation and you know sometimes it certainly sounds better than it is it does unlimited really mean unlimited or are not great question. But I think there is a perception that that is kind of the the new norm and working flexibly is. Is what? Is attracting attracting good talent? Um. So one of the things we might consider is. Just looking at our current policy and seeing if it makes sense to to add a week, you know, not everyone is going to necessarily use that extra week, but it might help us be competitive against some of those unlimited vacation policies or as they are on paper. So what are your thoughts on that approach?",3.0
"Hi, yes, happy Friday. Yes. I mean, so did you have a chance to think about our previous conversation? Um, curious if you've had it, had a chance to digest and had any more thoughts? Yeah, thanks. I mean it's it's a lot to think about. It's a lot to consider. I, I know it's a big change, but you know when we're out there in the market, especially with you know the great resignation and everything, I I think it's really going to help us be competitive, keep amazing talent, keep our employees happy so that we are continuing to deliver excellent service to our clients, which is obviously you know as you know it's one of our key differentiators and if we can. Keep doing that just at the minor expense of one additional vacation week per year. I mean, it seems like a great trade off.",3.0
"Hi, Lisa, good to see you. Thank you for making the time to meet with me. Last time we met, you were in the process of packing up your whole family for your move out to Connecticut. Can we welcome our newest resident? Oh, fantastic. Well, welcome to Connecticut, just in time for the fall foliage. Well, I'm glad it was a smooth move and I know that you're very busy right now trying to organize the team. So I wanted um especially where especially appreciative for you, making the time to meet with us. Um, you know, just to kind of go over some of the groundwork. Um, that's already gone on. Our, our CEO's have met Robin shared some notes with the meat from the meeting with Alan. And, you know, one of the things that they highlighted in this session was the consideration for growth. In your alternative side of the business. And so we're excited to be a part of that and interested in learning some of your priorities from the CFO perspective there. Oh, thank you for sharing that. So if I'm understanding correctly, you're looking at growing out the private markets leg of the business? What are some of the things that have created challenges for you there? You know, I can share with you. Um, we've spent some time with a number of your.",3.0
"Will you, Sir? Thank you so much for sharing your priorities and some of the challenges that you're having in growing your alternative strategies. Um, you know, maybe I can just go through a quick recap of what we've heard and speak a little bit about where we think we can help. Um, so the first thing, and I, I know that we discussed it at some length, is that you're looking for a partner for the future. And um, one of the things that I heard from you as we were speaking is that the right partner will be able to create an improved investor experience. Across, you know, you're 40 act book, which we already look after today and then across the various private markets businesses that you have today, one of the challenges and actually it's something that um your peers are experiencing as well is that when you look across your investor base, you often see that the same investor is investing in many different strategies. And when you have different platforms supporting this strategy is the investor experience can differ. KYC is sometimes um. Performed multiple times. Sometimes the investor experience in terms of receiving distributions or investor communications is different depending on which product they're invested in were being. Why melon can help with that is that we're looking at developing something called the investor master and essentially what this does is unify investor experience across all of your products because we understand that the investor experience really does Dr stickiness in terms of the investor assets and also it creates the level of transparency that your investors. Er advisors need to understand what they're invested in and what the risks in those products and make sure that, um, everything that they're doing with you brings enhanced valued for their portfolio. So that's where we'd start. We'd start with investor experience and then moving through the funds and what else we would bring to the table would be consolidated reporting on your end so that you get a consolidated risk view and portfolio view across all of the assets that you have, both traditional and nontraditional. Um, you know, thinking through four to the future, um, data strategy that we discussed with my colleagues, um, around bringing those asset types and and that information together. Um is critical and I think that you said that a few times. So I just want to pause there and see if you have any questions around investor experience, um, the consolidated dated reporting across your private markets?",3.0
"Lisa, um statistic I'd like to share with you is the scale of our organization. We have 45 trillion in assets under custody and or administration, which makes us the largest custodian and I know everybody likes to say I'm I'm a big custodian, you know, what does that mean for you? So, um, when we when we think about what that means for our clients and and how we help you grow your business using our scale. It really comes down to the value in the market advocacy. So you know I'll give you an example and I think that you saw this with a 40 ACT funds that are with us today. When you wanted to launch a product that was very focused on emerging markets, we were able to get those markets open for you rapidly and we even intervened in some of the tax issues that one of your investors was having in that market. And I think this scale that we have in the market because of that 45 trillion across all markets has given us a position with our sub custodians and you know even to some extent with the regulators. To help shape good outcomes for our clients. That's a really good question. So, um, right, with the state St BBH acquisition, they're also growing their assets. I think that it's important to note that, um, where those assets actually are, is it all USA is a global assets for us. We're very lucky in that we have that global reach and presence that aligns with your company's strategies across the board.",3.0
"Lisa, thanks for sharing that feedback. I know that Bank of New York is a giant firm. We touched so much of the world's financial markets that sometimes the value proposition can sound confusing, especially because it has so many pieces. I think the best way to look at it though or the best way that I can describe it is by looking at through through your eyes. And you shared with me early on when we first were getting to know each other that your primary objective is to grow assets in your alternatives and 40 Act business here in the US and start building your use its business. Um, in in Ireland and the value proposition that we bring specifically for you and your firm is that we can help you do them. And the way that we help you do that is proven. We've done it before. We've done it with other clients. We've shared with you how we can bring data and analytics and distribution capabilities together to build your franchise. And that's really the heart event. So yes, we're we're great fund accountants. Um, we're going to help you get better access. Today to on your funds, but most importantly we're aligned with your number one objective, which is growing assets.",3.0
"Charlie, hi. Thank you for making the time to talk about this with me. That's right. Thank you. Um, so one of the things that's come up lately with a lot of my team and I think more broadly across the organization has been the flexibility, um, or what they're perceiving to be Alexa, flex, lack of flexibility here, eh, regards to paid time off. And as I think you're aware, you know the scores that we have in pecan and um, you know what we're seeing in relationship to our peers and some of the broader trends in human resources .2 less engagement from some of our employees. And they're really big, costly fixes that we could put into place out there. And there are less costly fixes that we could put into place. And I think one of the best ways that we could get in bridge the gap between where our employees are today and where we think we'd like them to be. We'd be in listening a little bit to what they're asking us to do around paid time off. And I know I've been in this business for awhile and it's changed so much and a lot of our employees have different goals and different ways of working then I think I did when I first got started. I remember my first banking job, I didn't even use the time off that I had. But I think as we, um, you know, we look at the productivity that we have with our people, they're actually working more during the day. So we did a poll of all of the data that we could get. On when people are logged in and how productive they are and they're actually integrating their lives more fully with with the workplace. And that's exactly the behavior that we want. I think when your team alone, um, we've just seen folks that are really dedicated and pushing through big projects are getting delivered. So the productivity is there and I think it's there largely because this new generation in our workforce is actually working on integrating life into work so that they're working longer hours there. They're bringing more of this into their personal lives and that's great, but in order to continue to do that, we really do need to help them with some additional time.",3.0
"Hi Charlie, thanks for making the time for me. Yep. So to recap in our last meeting um we shared some statistics around where employees are with satisfaction and the single you know clear request that that we've been able to still has been for an additional week of time off. And you shared with us that um you know it adds to the cost of attrition um and and it and it provides um you know some additional risk around productivity. So I wanted to address, um, you know, those two objections and see where your thoughts were on anything else. So, you know, in terms of the first one with attrition, but I thought we could do, um is maybe achieve a compromise there by offering an additional week of paid time off, but removing that from um severance and from pay if an employee voluntarily leaves the firm. That would protect, uh, you know, our, our bottom line. It also will allow us to offer a little bit more time to employees. How does that sound? Go ahead. And then I also want to be mindful of your your other concern. Right. Around productivity. So can you help me understand a little bit?",3.0
"Nope. Um. I was put on out. Um. Jesus Christ. Right there, 30, said God. Don't um, tape do any work waiting. So is it a kettle? Yeah. That's just doing it in 15 more seconds. So let's just attach yet they said puppet just. You'll probably have codes that benchmark on it. Me? No.",
"Hi, everybody. Thanks for joining the workshop today. And I don't think we need to introductions 'cause. Everybody knows everybody, which is good and will save some time. So we're just going to spend a little bit of time scoping out this workshop, so everybody's clear and cover any actions to move this forward. So as everybody knows the scope of this workshop is looking at how we introduce electric vehicles, hire cars, leadings. So I think the scopes. Already clear? Uh, I guess the first question is anybody got any questions around the scope? Because I think it's always important that they start to get the scope very clear so we know what we're aiming for. So has anybody got any questions or anything around the scope first of all? Silence. He's wonderful. I always liked silence. So that's good. So everybody is clear on what the scope is. So what we're trying to do and in terms of this gold piece, basically get the electric vehicles CAP moved over in the next two weeks. So we've got quite a timeline to do this. So what I wanted to do is just get everybody's input in terms of what they think maybe, um, the critical items that we need to address and then we're going to clearly then put them into a bit of a mini plan. What we'll do after this, he set up a weekly call with everybody so we can keep things progressed and it would really, really be good if anybody could make sure they attend the weekly calls. So I'll put them in straight after this. So as I step scope is quite clear at the time lines were clear and I'd just like to just check at the moment as anybody got any questions before we start getting into some of the critical areas. So has anybody got any questions at all and you can have a. Speak now or put your hand up. Oh, that's great. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks K for putting your hand up. So what, what, what's your question? And then we can ask the group. So I'm just going to pretend now that case asked a question. That's a good question, Kate. Kate, thanks for raising that once. Really important that we're all clear on it. So yeah, so this is across all Siemens operating company that's that's the answer to that case. We're gonna roll it out across all seems operating companies, but we are going to focus probably first on Siemens mobility as a pilot and then after that pilot what we'll do is um review, see how it's gone and rolled out to the next businesses. So I think it's really important that we focus on one um one business first get it live. Get some lessons learned and then move on from there. So thanks Kate for asking that question. It's really useful. So without further ado, we've done the scope, we've done the timelines, we've covered any questions, what people need to do. And so I just really then like to ask anybody, um, what they've got in terms of what they think is a critical success, what, you know, once we've got this in, what would success look like and what do we need to achieve? So I'll just put it out again to everybody to Umm, he's got a question. Oh, thanks. Thanks, Todd. Thanks, Tom. That's a good question yet. That's a good question. Yeah. So the question that Tom, Ah, so obviously was around, um, what sort of stats would look like because it's always important to you found success. And my personal view is that if we can get this here in the timeline, we can get end user feedback. We can then present that in a small slide set, present it back to the Fleet Steering Committee and then from the fleet stealing committed and we can then get agreement to roll it out further. So, so, so I think that's uh. Good question and a good way of moving forward on this one. So thanks, Tom, for asking that question. Great stuff. So we get on really well here. Just looking at time, there's not much time left. Um. So let's pretend that we've been had this workshop for quite some time. So I think closing thing is, um, now we've got everything agreed with clear. I'll summarize the actions and the actions owners. I'll set up the weekly, Carl, and then what will do is on the call next week, will start deep diving into some of the actions, creating some owners and so on. So hopefully that's OK, everybody. And I'll speak to you next week on the call if anybody got any questions in the mean time. By all means, drop me.",3.0
"Hey, Lisa, it's so nice to meet you. So your boss mentioned that you're from originally from San Francisco. Whereabouts? Oh, that's the one. You're saying my family lives north of the city as well? Too small world. So how long have you been based here in Connecticut for? Tell me a little bit about your background. OK, yeah, great. Um, one of my colleagues had told me that you had been interested in exploring our capabilities here in Aultz and curious if there's any specific questions I can answer for you. Well, I know that some of our senior executives have been very close to your management and there's been conversations that have been ongoing. What have you heard from those? Oh, that's great.",5.0
"Lisa, I'm sure you've heard about our capabilities in the alternative space, but I just want to re emphasize a couple points to you today. So we do support support some of the largest global alt managers in the industry and that's because our open architecture platform allows our clients the flexibility to access different asset types across our servicing capabilities. And through integrating your data onto our online portal allows us to be able to provide to you the best in class reporting.

"Hey Frank, you know, I really wanted to talk to you about considering expanding our paid time off for holiday time by a week next year. You know, I think with the pandemic, people have just been really burnt out. They worked so hard for so long for two years in home in a really stressful environment and I think, you know, in many ways. People need that extra time to be able to disconnect because with the working from home so often, as much as we said we were taking time off, we were just so accessible to our computers that oftentimes we may be taking vacation time, but we would still end up working. That's just the nature of our jobs in the way it is today in the industry. And I know you've been around for a long time where you work well, some would say is like the warrior of our industry, but so much has changed, right and in order for us to be able to keep our talent. We have to be able to kind of compete with others in the industry or we're going to see them leaving finance and moving to other areas, right. You see all these tech firms that are supporting these unlimited vacation time and flexible work arrangements. And I think we really just have to be more adaptive to understanding peoples needs in recognizing that people do work so hard that it's to our benefit to keep our people long term if we extend our time off and allow people to. Really feel the ability to disconnect from their jobs.",6.0
"So, Mark, what other information can I give you to get you on board with this idea of extending our paid time off by another week? OK. Yeah, I just, I really think that the staff could benefit from that additional time. We've all really put in a lot of good effort. And if we want to continue to retain talent, especially in the wake of this great resignation. We have to think about what is incentivizing people to want to stay at companies. And to me, you think about it, vacation time is so coveted in the world we work in today where we're constantly on call and on demand 24/7, giving people that flexibility of having an. Extra week off may mean the difference of keeping staff or losing staff to companies that have decided to implement a no limit vacation policy, right? So this kind of falls somewhere in the middle. Give people enough time that they feel good that management is giving them a benefit without may be worried about people that may abuse the policies of work from wherever.",6.0

Strong reputation and we'd be happy to have you come on board and talk about kind of the different aspects of. What kind of goes into this and? What the transition would be like, I know we have a great history in the past. We have a really strong alternatives team all around and our support is phenomenal. So we really want to make this. As strong of. A relationship for both of us. And I'd love to kind of get into the nitty gritty. Do you have any questions right off the bat? Excellent. That's great to hear. And from here we can kind of move forward and we can start talking about data points. We can get through kind of the nitty gritty of. What's going on and? What we can do to kind of bring this all together?",3.0
"OK, Lisa. So I can sit here and say what I've been saying that we're the best and you want to come bring your business over with us.

And that that number, that $45 trillion should speak volumes because if you're thinking about. Just in comparison to other businesses, if you're looking on Amazon and you're looking for. Let's say a new vacuum and one has. 45,000 positive reviews and another one might have 7000 positive reviews. You're going to be more inclined to go to the one that everybody wants. Um. And people want it because they have the best features, they have the best support, they have the best service. And in this environment, that's bank New York Mellon.",4.0
OK. Thank you for bringing that up. So I want to let you know that we can definitely break it down for you. There is several different ways that we can kind of. Look at the full value for you. We can bring in a couple teams. I think it would be a great option if we set up a separate call where we can talk with art data team and somebody specifically from our old just to kind of break things down for you. And explain where these numbers come from and everything that we can do for you. We want to make sure that you feel confident. And that you leave here with all the information that. Makes you feel comfortable.,3.0
"Hello, how are you today? Great. I just wanted to have a conversation. I know something that's been top of mine, which I know can be a tricky conversation. Is holiday time. I think. Well, we have. A solid set up for holiday time. There could potentially be some room for a little bit more. I know as we've switched to a more hybrid environment. It makes it a little more difficult for people to be. Encouraged to take time off because a lot of things can be done on days where we used to take those days and give breaks to employees. But I think if we did offer a little bit more holiday time. In particular. In that area around the holidays, people would be more inclined to take those breaks. And studies have shown significantly that productivity will increase. If we do take those breaks. I know there may be some financial concerns and I think that's worth looking at. But I think we also need to be cognizant of peoples burnout. Because at the end of the day. If people aren't doing their best, it is also hurting the company and that can impact trifold, so it's definitely, I think, an important conversation to have about. Making sure our employees to take that time to ourselves. And help the company overall. Be more successful.",3.0
"Excellent. Thank you for your consideration. I think one of the biggest things to look at is to compare how the data is worked if you look at company XYZ. They've implemented an extra week of the holiday end time off leave. To match what words would be at and they have seen. Extraordinary productivity growth. And we want to be at that level. If we can do just that one thing and that's what sets us aside from this up to the next level, I think it would really make sense for our company to implement this.",4.0
"Will give morning Lisa to pleasure to meet you. My name is Tim Marchand. Oh, and I'm with BNY Mellon. Yes, absolutely. So, um, understand you're originally from San Francisco? Is that right? And you're based in Connecticut now? Yes, I'm I'm based in Pittsburgh. I've been um relationship manager with BNY Mellon asset servicing and I've been fortunate to be with our company for more than more than 30 years. So currently working with our clients, supporting their investment programs. And very pleased to make your acquaintance and happy to answer any questions you may have about our organization, but I know you're you're somewhat acquainted. What were your initial impressions? Excellent. Great to hear.",4.0
"Well, they said it's it's great getting acquainted with you. Perhaps we could spend some time discussing our BNY Mellon's capabilities to support your alternative investment portfolios. You may now be in my melon is a market leader in alternative investments. For example, we've been servicing our client assets for more than 45 years since 1977. In terms of size, we have. Uhhh Industries largest program with more than 5 trillion in alternative investments on our platform. Our program services more than 400 clients right around the globe and we implement our support through a single operating model and a single system around the globe which allows for a cohesive client experience. Given the strong relationship among our organizations at the executive level, I'm very confident we'll have the resources to support you and are so review. BNY Mellon supports more than $5 trillion on a single platform and we've got a tremendous commitment to the business. Be happy to address any questions you may have.",4.0
"Well, absolutely. Listen, again, I want to thank you for spending time today to get acquainted. I know you're very busy and I've been very pleased to provide background on BNY Mellon, but one of the points I wanted to make is BNY Mellon actually has over $45 trillion of assets under custody administration, and that puts us at the very pinnacle. Of the industry and our ability to support you is not surpassed by any other competitors. So that should give you great confidence between the size and scale of BNY Mellon and the senior executive contacts that you have with BNY Mellon that were. Very well poised to be able to support your investments.",4.0
"Well, hello, Lisa. Yes, I completely understand our value proposition can be hard to follow. There are always many considerations as it relates to alternative investments. But to break it down, BNY Mellon's proposition relies on three main pillars. One, the size of our business, making us #1 globally in terms of the commitment to the business, the fact that we have a single operating model in a single system globally that again provides for a consistent experience. Uh, right around the world as your investments are distributed globally and also leads to tremendous benefits from a business continuity and resiliency perspective. And then finally the contacts we have among our organizations at the very senior level that it will absolutely ensure success in our endeavour between our organizations.",4.0
"Well, good morning, Jim. Thanks for spending some time to catch up on the issue that. We're aware of regarding our employees request for additional paid time off. Ah, Jim, I know you've been with the organization for more than 30 years, so I suspect you've seen this, seen this before. So I'd really like to rely on your experience. I do have a few thoughts though. Employees are asking for an additional one week of paid time off, and from my perspective, I think that's really going to, one, improve the performance of our organization if the employees have armor rested and are able to bring their entire self to their job every day. And two, in this environment, I think it's going to improve the retention that we have. With our employee base and in the end, the combination of both the improved performance and the improve retention is going to lead to a much better situation for BNY Mellon. In the end, it's going to lead to. You know, a much stronger organization, so thanks for spending the time. I know you've got a tremendous amount of experience here and love to hear your. Really love to hear your thoughts here. Thanks. Thanks, Jim.",4.0
"Well, yes, Jim, I understand you have reservations about my recommendation to increase the paid time off. Buy an additional week, and while I would personally guarantee improved performance and retention for myself, you know, perhaps we should seek additional. Eration, so let me dig in and quantify a bit the benefits of increasing personal time off 1. Increasing personal time off will allow our colleagues to devote additional time to the office around the busiest month and in coordinate around periods if they know they have the ability to take time off subsequent to the busy periods. Also increasing paid time off will allow us to compete with our local competitors who provided this benefit to their employees. So in summary, the combination of these two benefits will ensure a tremendous dividend is paid to BNY Mellon. So thank you for considering.",4.0

"Hi everybody. Welcome back to your Chapter Free future of procurement. In this chapter will have a look at global trends changing the world and their impact on our function procurement. We will have two sections. In the first one, there will be the impact on our fraction to discuss. That means you have a look at the various trends described on trend cards you can see below. When you have the trend cards discussed in your crew, you will drag them on the dartboard into three sections. That means you have the low impact, the medium, and the high impact section. Try not to over think you have about a minute patron because you have a lot of cards to discuss. Some also might be less obvious. That means. It cannot find a connection for procurement, but take them as a chance to broaden your horizon and maybe some of your group partners will find a good solution for this thread card. When you finished your threats, you would stack come into Step 2. That is new rules of procurement. Based on your findings and discussions, you will think about new rules. We need in the future these new rules and procurement shuffle fill different trends and should be successful in the context of these trends. You were focused on the trends in the medium and high impact projection. Combined them if useful. He says the cat and the cat is my cat. Sustained. And if you have any questions regarding cats, he will answer it. But we will go on. You can use your train cars and your findings and ideas during your discussion and come up with a precise sentence which starts. But we um procurement as. This will be your old statement and to make it a little bit easier I will give you an example. We in procurement as drivers and digitalization, stick with those one sentence statements for now. We will have a look into detail in later in the chapter. But what does that mean for you now? You will have 20 minutes to work in your groups. As you may remember from the last tasks, you will find breakout rooms with their names and you will find your group. Then you will have 20 minutes to discuss separately in your group about the trend cards, placing the train cards on the board, and you will do that um separately. Later on you will take a sticky notes. And post them on the trend cards to describe your ideas. Um, to find another feeling or maybe you have a discussion over that. Then you will have, um, just sticky notes and posted also 20 minutes. When you finished all this work, you will have 15 minutes to take these trends in your ideas to come up with a new roads of procurement. Don't forget we start with the phrase with we in procurement as this is will be your rule statement. And later on, we will meet in the main room, we will come back together and then you can have a brief presentation of the world statements you found and how they respond to the trends on the boards. So be prepared for a smart presentation and later on we will discuss your conclusions. Are there any questions left? So if not, then I would say have fun and if you have any questions we as moderators are there for you.",5.0
"Good morning, Lisa. Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me today. I truly appreciate it. Um, and I just wanted to say that Roman Regelman says hello and he also sends his regards to your CEO, John. And he'd really like to have an opportunity to see you, whether it's in San Francisco or or in Connecticut. Um, whenever you have the time, let me know and I can arrange that. And Speaking of San Francisco and Connecticut, how is your commute? I know you were going back and forth. Is it more virtually spending more time in Connecticut now? Oh, wow, that's interesting. So how, how is that hybrid model working at your organization? Is it two days in the office or three and how our employees embracing that? Great. I'm glad to hear that it's working out. Um, I just wanted to also ask you, you know, you mentioned that you're considering moving the alternatives business and just what are the reasons that you are considering that move? What are some of the top reasons for a custodial change?",3.0
"Hi, Lisa. So you know, um, I wanna thank you again for considering BNY Mellon as a potential of vendor for your alternatives and I know you've been talking to our competitors as well. So I really wanted to just highlight some of the key competitive advantages that we have versus our competitors. First of all and I'm sure you know that we are the number one provider in the alternative space. We are very committed to the to this business. Asset servicing is what we do. Here at BNY Mellon, and I know that you had mentioned your concern on um in accuracy of data, disparate systems and the frustration of all of that. And at BNY Mellon, we have one fully integrated accounting, custody, accounting, performance measurement, analytics. Um, and I would love to get to do a deep dive on that for you and your staff. And then, um, also very important. I know it's for your CIO. The chief investment officer is looking for a better way. More meaningful way to manage data and um and to expand his analytical capabilities and our open architecture is really resonating with clients and would love to get into um or discussion with that with the appropriate your appropriate staff members.",3.0
"Lisa, thank you for asking. Um, as far as where we aren't compared to our competitors as far as size, BNY Mellon has 45 trillion in assets under custody and administration. That's a large number, but the number itself means nothing. But why is it important to you and it is because it demonstrates our commitment to this business and the the the strength we have with all the clients that have joined and the best practices that you could have. Um, at your disposal, we're committed to this business and we're here for the long run. We spend over $3 billion in assets for investments in technology and our technology spend. So that's important because as your allocation to assets and you know we're talking about the alternatives has grows where they are to grow with you. And then again, we also are very committed to this business and in hiring top talent, it allows us to do that and and provide you high touch service.",3.0
"Hi, Lisa, I am here to just um talk to you about the potential of expanding time off and you know holiday leave by a week. And I just want to kind of go through my thoughts on why I think that that's something that we should consider as an organization. As you know with COVID and the past number of years you know your staff has been working around the clock, it's no longer A9 to five job and. You know, people are getting burnt out, you can see it, you can feel it, the energy isn't there as it used to be. And also we're seeing a lot of resignations, which is not helping us in order to retain our talent, very experienced teams, you know, we need to do something and enhance their work life balance and I think it would be a great and very much appreciated if we were to. You know, give them an extra week of vacation. And when you think about it, that would be. Really bringing in bringing us up to the level of where the rest of the world or at least in Europe they they get that extra week off and I think that you know they're organizations have not had any issues with productivity by doing that. As a matter of fact I think it's just their their employees become longer, longer employees and are just happy with their work life balance. So I would really like you to consider that one extra week off. I think we're gonna, you know, benefit more than it would be a negative. It will increase productivity and reduce the turnover. I thank you for your time and truly appreciate you thinking about that. Thank you.",3.0
"I am so, so happy that you are considering giving the employees an extra week off of paid leave. I think that that's great. Not only will it keep our, you know, employees happy and motivated, it will also help in recruiting top talent from other companies that do not have this offer. And so I think it's good all the way around and I think let's just try it, let's try it for a year and then reevaluate. Um, I think that that would be wonderful. Thank you so much.",5.0
"So, Lisa, I I hear what you're saying and that you find the the BNY Mellon's value proposition to be confusing. So let me just put it in real simple terms. It's our value proposition is we're going to provide you core capabilities that are fully integrated and reliable. It's reliable data so that you don't have to be reconciling and questioning the data that you have and all of that wrapped with the data solution. Um, there is an open architecture environment allowing you the optionality to integrate third party providers of your choice, and this will allow for the Chief Investment Officer to have more meaningful data so that he can make better investment decisions.",4.0
"Lisa, how you doing again this is Mike. Just wanted to let you know that BNY currently has $45 trillion assets under management in custody and admin services. So just wanted to let you know that your money and your services that require. Your assets are safe, would be and why were the most respected banks? With the Bank of Banks we can do anything. That your services and your business requires in order to succeed at a very high level as well as hold your assets in a clear and concise and secure way.",5.0
"Hi, I think that. We have not fully explained our capabilities, that being why, in order to fully make you aware of what we are capable of and what we are willing to do for you and to provide you the best client service as possible. I think if we could talk a little bit more about our capabilities and our strategies and to make your business a better place and uh, to make your business more efficient, I think we should set up another call and maybe we can help you better understand what we're capable of.",4.0
"Hi, how you doing? I just wonder, in regards to my extension of my vacation time, I wanted to justify those extra weekend that allowed time off. I think this time away make taking a step back well, namely will enable me to really decompress and to think and to have that family time with my family, with my loved ones in order to refocus my energy to some that could. Come back to work and be fully efficient. Fully enabled to tackle any responsibility possible, but I think every now and then people need to take a step back and then take a step forward. So I think enable me an extra week will provide me that value in that time away from work to really come back recharged, energized to tackle any obstacle possible. Thank you for your time.",5.0
"I just wanted to justify my last point on taking an extended leave for vacation, you know? Again, I think it's crucial to take a step back, to decompress with the family in order to really come back recharged, ready to work, ready to have that valuable time with the family, reflecting on what's important in my life, to come back to work and to be charged and be ready to go, to tackle any obstacle in front, I think this is really important for my benefit. And also for the firm and our teams benefit in a whole.",5.0
"Lisa, how are you doing? It's really nice to meet you. My name is Mike Ruane. Uhhh, I currently work in the NYC office. I understand that you are from Connecticut. I'm actually from the Northeast as well. From New Jersey. Born and raised. Um, saw that you're you're from originally from San Francisco. It's awesome. It's a great spot to live. I just wanted to introduce myself and start the relationship there.",5.0
"Lisa, how you doing? I understand you've been shop around the market for alternatives service provider. Uh, I just wanted to let you know that being why is first to none. We not only offer customization and alternative product, I myself work within the alternative product. We provide great customer service within the custody and admin services provide any need that it's possible that you have in the alternative. Investments that you have within your insurance company um provide reasonable and affordable pricing for your company as it grows to scale and. Let you know that we have a great reputation behind ourselves. We pride ourselves on Great Expectations, meeting with expectations and providing the best service possible for our clients. I hope we can continue this relationship and we can get into more details as we proceed with this relationship going forward. Thank you for your time.",5.0
"Hi, Lisa, um, Greg, Mr Angela, I represent. BNY Mellon. Alternative servicing group that take you like to thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. I'm sure as a CFO of such a large company you have a really full calendar. I understand you're looking to convert your alternatives servicing provider. I don't know what sort of challenges or service gaps are you seeing with your current custodian?",4.0
"So really interesting stat about BNY Mellon is that we have $45 trillion under custody, which is actually 20% of the assets in the world because we have 20% of the assets in the world to $45 trillion under custody. While you know we're globally systemic important bank, we are too big to fail as some people might say, which actually means that your assets will be secure. I know that that number of 45. Um can seem. Intimidating? But with the service that we're able to offer you and the single point of contact, it will really make it feel like you're dealing with and doing business with a smaller organization. And not one that is custody in 20% of the world's assets.",4.0
"So, you know, at BNY Mellon we can really offer you a single. Um, fully integrated operational support for all of your alternative investments. We can offer and provide funding administration, fund accounting, cash movements, daily NAV delivery, UM and on top of for all of your alternative assets including private equity, private credit, real estate funds, you know, whatever your book is made-up of on top of that. We would have had a single point of contact sitar, experienced, tenured relationship manager who's familiar with. The alternatives industry um, how the investments work, and you know that relationship manager will be available as a single point of contact in the event you know that you need assistance navigating the organization. In order to continue to. Manage your alternatives portfolio.",3.0
You are not the only client to tell me that our value proposition can be a little confusing and I can see why you would feel that way as we do offer multiple services for some of the world's most complex and largest clients. Would it be helpful if I set up? Meetings with senior level managers from our operations group for all of the services that you require and they could go into some deeper detail on. What their teams could provide your assets?,6.0
"No, I have heard from some whispers from some of the. The cohorts that the amount of vacation time currently a lot of reach employment really isn't in line with what they've seen in other companies and what is really become an industry standard of five weeks a year. You know, another week added for each employee. I think would really boost really good some good well and I think it would lessen the amount of turnover that the company is currently experienced. Now I understand that there is a big cost to. Um, add this to the books and know that you need to pay everyone another week. But I think that that cost would be recouped very easily. Tenfold twentyfold by just eliminating some of the turnover, and also. It would allow for. More Goodwill ambassadors, employees that have more good things to say about the company then bad things when they're out there talking to their friends or their relatives. Like, oh, I want to hear from somebody like, hey, guess what? The CFO at my company just gave us another week of vacation. How awesome is that?",5.0
"Increasing paid time off allotment is a short term cost that will pay off in the long term. By adding another week you will increase increase productivity, reduce sick calls, and reduce turnover. You know where by low productivity sick calls and turn over a very expensive and costly for the organization not only in dollars but in time and frustration for everyone that works here. Um. I think that if you were to do this, you would see a real tangible payback over time. In employee satisfaction, productivity and reduce turnover.",6.0

Now, how does that make you feel? close your eyes go through this situation. Imagine a big crowd of in front of you. Now. I want you to tell me.

I was standing in front of the crowd with a microphone in my head and I couldn't control my legs. They were shaking heavily. And I'm pretty sure that it was also obvious in my audience, but in this moment what really helped me was. I just close my eyes for a second. Just have a quick thought about this will be over in three seconds. It's not even worse. Imagine there's just an audience of one or two, or even no one. So I took a deep breath. Pause for a second. And then I started to deliver my speech. It was three minutes of rocking it and this 3 minutes ended with a standing ovation. This is how my speech went and I hope this will be your speech at the end of this workshop.",5.0

"Hello and good afternoon. My name is Alex Carlton notice and I'm from the global SCM organization within demons. I'm basically responsible for. Our team here who is acting as UM channel to the digitalization topics. So my team is responsible for all the technical demands and enhancement of our maintained digital platforms. So what we are doing at the moment and especially I would like to present one specific project, this is the my mole project. Here I'm acting as the counterpart for the supply chain management. So that means I'm doing all the, um, content topics and content enhancement within our platform. I'm all. So this is the channel to the functional excellence within this project. So one topic I would like to introduce to you is a new functionality called Easy price request. So with this easy price request function you are able to do electronically. Good easy prizes and a request for quotation. Um, what is my model and what is mammal all about? So my mall is a global platform acting as a kind of entry point for all demons employees in more than 45 countries. So it offers a search and find. Platform to our purchasing demands. It's it's offering as well a kind of powerful search engine, enable comparison and for selected catalog materials and its design for our own mimolette dashboard. So my model acts as a kind of cloud interface platform connecting all demons companies, but leaving the integration targets to the businesses. So that means either it's the back end. Er P or 1S emm. Um, So what are the minor capabilities? So it offers a multi connection platform. So that means we are quite high flexible for various sites and downstream integrations. It's a kind of single point of entry. So that means all purchasing applications are under one roof and it has another topic and a feature which is the price and delivery time optimization. So whatever contents we have integrated, it provides a unique. Catalog content search under one UI and in addition for sure it's the top target, it's the user experience. So this platform offers you intuitive E shopping platform which gives the user the chance to find all um. Contents, um, and activities for his demand. Yeah. So I would like as well to go further in the easy price request function so the electronic could request for quotation. So what is um this function all about so I'm easy. Price request can be sent out to any kind of demons order. So the demand can easily described in my model and send electronically request to selected suppliers. So the supplier selection is specifically. Done by the country and you as a supplier have the possibility to quote on a specific request. So it's a full digital process and for sure what are the targets for this functionality. It reduces the cost by voting free text and increases the node touch rate in that regards. So with these basic works, I hope to give you a quick introduction. And um. Tokyo then later. Bye bye.",3.0

So um, after that I need to record myself. Delivering a section and what you love the digital mind workshop. That is mine worked up I did 1 1/2 years ago. So I really have to think about the content again and have to go through the concept board. Um, which I haven't done yet, but they're recording their liners September 23rd, so this should be alright. Um, yeah. So in 2 minutes we're having a call with. Alex and um, I'm curious if he will. If you will tell me what's still missing apart from the benchmark which is not yet.",
"Hello everybody and welcome to our digital mind workshop. My name is Sabina Nitrofuran. I work for supply chain management. We will spend the next few days together and our agenda is packed with interesting stuff and interesting people. Before we come to the agenda, let me quickly have a small introduction on the purpose and why. At all, we decided to have workshops on teachers and mind. Did you remind? Has towards its mind and digital as you are aware of. And when we talk about mind and mindset. Um. I think it becomes more and more important to be aware of how important the role of a mind and a mindset is. Um, actually? It's all about mindset. Um, to be, to make up your mind, to be mindful, to be attentive? Um, to see things from a different perspective? Um, I think that's one of the most important. Perspectives, um, that we have in this regard? And um. You all notice that in the past you can see one and the same thing happens, and you can you see it differently, and you shut it differently on one day or the other day. This has to do with mindset. What kind of a mind set do you have today? It's flexible and I think digital Y digital, I think, um, this is pretty clear. It's all about digital, um, things. Everything becomes digital. Data is the new gold. So we decided on digital mind and really focus on that to have a progress on our supply chain functionality. So coming to why procurement while supply chain management? Um, how important is the digital mind for our role and what does it mean for the role of procurement and the future of procurement? Um. We will talk about how to deal with different trends we are facing at the moment in our world, not only in a procurement, procurement and supply chain. Management has to find answers to those trends. And we will have an exercise for that where we already prefilled some of the trends that are obvious like demographic change, like. Climate change and things like that. Um, and we will rate them as to how big is the impact to our role and to our tasks at procurement. So does this trend have a low impact, median impact or high impact? And we will go through that exercise on our concept board and we prefilled cards as I said, but you will also have the opportunity if there's one trend that you think. Oh, this is, for me, the most important trend at all. But it's missing. Um, you can fill your own trend cards, edit and put it on a concept board as well, and then we will discuss and by discussing. We will find a decision how the impact is and then we move further. So before we start that, let's go all onto the concept board and have a look.",4.0
"Well, thank you very much, Lisa. I really appreciate the insights you've given me into uh a bit about your your journey to this point and also um some thoughts around the decisions as to why you're looking to change your alternative business um management to, to to someone else in the market. So thank you for that really appreciate that. So there's there's probably two or three reasons why I think we are different to our competitors and why I also think that BNY Mellon are are able to service. Your needs in a in a clear in a way that would help you hopefully grow as an organization and we'll obviously to to help you walk through. That's obviously the first, the first point here that's important to me and important to you hopefully is that we are one of the largest alternative managers in the marketplace. We we have a huge insurance backed alternatives management business. Um #2 on that is on our list that we're talking through here as we look at the slides is that. Um, we are, we have a global footprint. So our global footprint encompases 24/7, 365 days a year. Um, we have a follow the sun model which and which means that any processing that you happen to get stuck into an end of day process, end of day cycle, we're able to manage that through as the as the day ticks around the globe. And lastly, we feel that it's really important that you have a dedicated client manager that works with you throughout your transition into your operational. Uh, go live and that person is the single point of contact for your organization, um, and will be there to help you understand what's happening, when it's happening and why. So we think that's those are the three things that really stand us aside from the market.",3.0
"So Lisa as part of. You know, our general course of business and how we, we, you know, how conversation that we're having at this morning. Um, I think it's important to kind of credential eyes, ourself and our business. And I wanted to kind of give you some some interesting facts that will allow you to at least understand the scale of the operation that we have and also the number of clients that trust us to manage their assets for them. So the first piece of data that we're talking about here is the fact that we have $45 trillion. Birth of of assets under custody and administration. So as you can imagine, we are, uh, we are a, uh, complex organization that has significant controls in place and enough people and enough processes to handle that complexity and that level of level of trust from our clients. And I think that kind of adds adds some credence and credibility to our conversation today.",2.0
"Hi, Lisa, love you to meet you. Um, albea virtually. I know it's not ideal, and I would love to come out to Connecticut and meet you face to face if everything progresses well before we get started. I just kind of wanted to. Tell you a bit about myself, a bit about why we're here, um, hopefully to set the context for conversations as we progress. And also I'd love to hear a bit more about you, um, why you chose to move from San Francisco to Connecticut was at a business thing. Is it personal? So from my perspective, I've been at the bank for about a year. I've been in financial services for roughly 22 years or so. Um. Journey. I've been kind of perfecting my craft and learning how we can use our services and solutions to help our clients, so I'd love to hear a bit more about you before we get into the whole meat of the of the of the conversation.",2.0
"OK. Lisa, I understand the question, but I understand that initially, uh, an organization that the size of BNY Mellon actually is that the full value proposition maybe a little bit confusing initially. Um, that's why we take it very seriously. Then we work with our clients and with our prospects during this education and information gathering phase to help tailor the offering to really meet your needs and to really solve your key objectives, so. So from the perspective of today's meeting, I I wanted to give you a feeling of the size of the organization. However, be very clear in that it's my responsibility to make sure that you walk out of this meeting knowing exactly what's important to you and what the what BNY Mellon can bring to your organization that's going to help you specifically.",3.0
"So David, I wanted to get some time in your diary to to discuss something that I know is gonna take more conversation and I know he's going to be something that you're gonna have objections about or concerns, but let's let's go through the process and I want you to to hear me out. So the proposition or the proposal that I'm putting forward is to give our workforce our teams an additional week or five days of annual holiday to take every year. Which moves us from 25 days to 30 days. Now, before we get into any of the other. Why we can't do this part of the conversation, I think is important to understand that that studies have shown that. Staff retention is greatly improved by offering something like this that allows them to to spend more time with their families. We've all been through the pandemic, we all understand that hybrid working is is going to be here for awhile now. What this allows us to do is to start to minimize. Unpaid time off or time where people are taking parental leave because they're out of there, out of annual leave to take. So it it removes that conversation and it it stops, stops out or takes our employee. It gives them a chance to feel like they're still contributing and not necessarily doing something that they're not allowed to do. And secondly, you know, to my second point. Something to bear in mind is we would be the only organization of our size in our marketplace that are offering this as part of any package for any employee. So we're going to attract more talent, we're going to attract talent that we are, we want to retain. We're going to be more competitive in the marketplace by doing that. Now let's let's get into why we want to, why we think that man would be a great idea next.",4.0
"So. Thanks very much for hearing me out and it's great that you think this is a great idea, as good an idea as I think it is. Um, I know um you've mentioned that that we want to see how this goes and and maybe push this into the next calendar year. The the the one thing I would say to all of this and and the important factor to bear in mind here is that we're in a, we're in a very, very, very short time period now where we can start to move put Clearwater between us and our competition. We can now make a decision that comes into effect. In the 1st of January, given that it's September already and we've got everything in place to to hit the ground running on the 1st of January and really change our culture is an organization and it's something we need to really decide on fairly quickly. So are we good to go or do we need more time? The balls in your court, I think we do it now and what I'd like to do is I think I've given you enough. Justification for making that choice.",3.0
"Hello, Lisa from. My name is David Motes. I work in business development here at BNY Mellon. Thank you very much for taking the call today. It's a pleasure to talk to you. Um, I see that you've based in Connecticut. I love Connecticut. How long have you been there? Love to hear from you.",4.0
"Police. I gather you've been looking at us for alternatives capability. Well, as you know, um, possibly don't have BNY Mellon. It's not the whole thing again. Coming. Let me know. No. Kill. Still a game. Stargate Lisa. So Lisa, thank you very much for considering BNY Mellon for your alternatives business. As you may aware, we're not. No, let's try again. Thank you, Lisa, as you may. Uh, there speak for at least 60 seconds. These are BNY Mellon is a market leader in alternative business with global reach, people at all the key markets, and we're ready here to service your requirements. So we'd love to talk to you about what we can do.",4.0
"So Lisa, I don't know whether you're familiar, but bank in New York is the oldest bank in America over 234 years, founded by the famous Alexander Hamilton. He have of musical fame and it was founded on the premise that we're going to save, save custody assets for clients. In those days it was it was cash and then it grew into securities and today it's grown to over 45 trillion worth of assets. And that's the promise that BNY Mellon. Delivers to clients is that safe custody of their assets and that's what we will bring to the piece for you.",4.0
So at least I hear what you say. Could you possibly explain to me why you find it confusing?,2.0
"Hey friend, how are you doing? Well, we've been really busy every year up to the limit, working all days, weekends, holidays and all the rest of it. It's just it's just getting too much. Um, listen, I don't know about you, but I just. I've got to take a break and I'm hoping that you won't mind if I take an extra week. I know it's a busy time. I've got full cover. Chris knows what to do. The schedules lightened up a little bit. Um, we've achieved our sales targets. I just, I just need to take some time off and I'm hope you're, you're OK with that. Please let me know. And if you think I need to make any other preparations ahead of this, then I'm happy to do that with you. So just let me know. Thank you. Speak for at least 60 seconds. Run out of things to say.",3.0
"Hey, Fred, thanks. Coming back for me about the holiday request, I mentioned you seem pretty OK with it, which is which which is great. Um, and concerning your concerns about this, um, actually I was speaking with K and she's prepared to cover for me if anything does come up next week, which I don't think is going to be the case. Also mentioned in the US is prepared to cover it from sales executive or perspective, so. I really think, you know coverage wise is there. I'm also prepared if there is anything that comes up unexpectedly for you to get me on my my cell phone. So if there are no other objections, if I send you a note now, would you be able to approve it and and then I can get going and book in my book in my time off would be fantastic. Thank you very much for your consideration in this case. I know it's a tough times but I really appreciate it. Thank you.",2.0
"Hi, Lisa. I'm Louise from Copenhagen in Denmark and really, really pleased to get to meet you today. Um it, um, it's interesting to have the opportunity to speak with you. I understand you come from San Francisco. Is that correct? Yeah, I've been there with my family on vacation. I don't know whether. Have you ever been to Copenhagen in Denmark? Anyway, um, really happy that to meet with you today. Thank you so much. Ah, yes. Well, yeah. We, we went out to see Alcatraz. Yeah. We went there as all the other tourists on that day. Yeah. Made sense. Yeah. It was good. It was a good trip. Yeah, absolutely. Well, um, on the other topics that we were to discuss today, I was wondering if you could. Yeah.",3.0
"I understand that you're looking to get some alternative business taking care of going forward and you are talking with our competitors. Yeah, I think we I would very much like to talk you through our our service offering and mind you from a BNY Mellon perspective, it's really important that you consider our global scope the. Imminent status of our service and also how we try to work proactively in providing their services that you otherwise might consider to be. Ended or something that you can get everywhere. Um, what we are really working harder is providing you the basic of service and then elevated to a level where you get to see our proactiveness in solving your needs and your requirements on what? On what you're considering lifting your. Uh, your deliverables to your clients at at the end of year, right. So a progressive growth strategy together with us.",3.0
"Confusing, I hear what you're saying because obviously we are a large organization with many business lines. However, I do think for your company, both the immediacy of the data available for you, the safekeeping of the assets combined with the relationship model that we have put together for you, making sure that you have one point of entry. Um, should be beneficial, but can you give me a little bit more as to what the confusion is? Where, where do you, um, where's the pain point in terms of where you are where you are not clear to see how we might be able to help you because. Um. It's important for us to get to that point.",4.0
"Hi. Oh yes. Well, just had the weekend off. It was such a great, such a great weekend. Hopefully also for you. Yeah, well, we are, you know, we are being kept pretty tight compared to the rest of the rest of the financial sector in terms of what our, um, paid off days and vacation breaks. Yeah. Yeah, well. Mind you, you know, in in general, um, usually in Denmark we we do have. We only have 4 weeks and the rest of the industry has five, right? So we are really, um, unconcerned about that from an. Or round perspective, um, in order for us to secure people, to stay happy with being my melon and to follow the sort of the market standard for paid leaves, yeah, it has evolved quite rapidly actually, and I think also following the pandemic, people have been more used to being able to control their time off. Yeah. I understand where you're coming from, but I really do think that we should have a look as to how that could also pay beneficial in our attention of the good employees because you know, the value of the younger people really is a. Consider a balance between their work life balance. So from that perspective, well, I'm I'm pretty. Well, I'm very much for us looking at extending the paid leave absence in the company, absolutely.",3.0
"I understand your concern, but I do really think that you want to come across as the one who really brought this bank into the next century, right? And being concerned about the work life balance of the younger staff. Um. And for all of us ready to take the next step, we I think it's really important. Why don't we agree for me to set up a meeting next week with HR and see? How we can progress on this? Yeah, I think that would be really, that would be really useful because I am concerned about how we attract and keep our young talent and people here if we are not on par at least with our competitors. So, yeah, you read, yeah, OK, that's an agreement then I'll, I'll follow up Tuesday next week. Thank you. Excellent. See you. Thanks.",3.0
"Importantly, Pny Mellon is taken care and safekeeping 45 trillion of U.S. dollars in assets under safety, and that amounts to. 3 * 3 times the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world that is trusted BNY Mellon with less with assets, right? So a lot of clients globally are basically looking for pny Mellon to save, keep that amount of money and assets with us. Um. So we take the safekeeping of Joyce. It's really, really seriously.",4.0
"Hello Lisa, very nice to meet you. Even though it's virtually um I heard from Michael that your your controller currently considering to to look for alternative service provider and I just happen to know that my colleague Brian and I will be in Los Angeles in the next couple of weeks. So I was wondering if we could certainly meet uh to discuss this matter. I think it would be very nice to meet personally and and discuss this. Interesting opportunities. So I would happy to for you to consider this, this point. So thank you very much for that.",2.0
"It is a very nice to meet you even though it's virtually, I'm very glad to be able to speak with you and I I heard that you you're considering converting your allbusiness in uh in Luxembourg, but I'm really glad to hear that you consider BNY Luxembourg for this matter as we are one of the largest service provider on the market. Have to tell you that over the last few years we've really focused on the business and we have developed a very strong expertise by Ari. So most some of the strongest partner on the on the market and I think all competitors are not so focused on the business in on this market. So I think it would be really nice if we could meet to together and introduce you to the specialist talking about allbusiness. Let's try to convene a. I'm meeting with those specialists and I'm very sure that it will be an interesting discussion for for you. So let's let's continue to connect and and finalize this this one. Thanks. Bye bye.",2.0
"Hey, Lisa, good to see you again. Yeah. Um, today I wanted to talk to you about the, the the data solution that we have in, uh, Alex, Um. So you, you certainly know that data is really, really key. Now that will be something we have been focusing on over the last few, uh, few years and as you know already. Largest custodian on the market. So we have a vast amount of data in in opposition and and we have we'll focus in providing insight on those data now. So we have been partnering with a number of intake in order to capitalize on this. On this amount of data and we've really be very keen to, um to demonstrate how we can manage this. Did these solutions, so let's let's meet together.",2.0
"Hey, Lisa, nice to connect again. Um, yeah, I wanted to come back on Alaska conversation and I understand you consider or proposition as a bit confusing. We really apologize if it is a if it's the case. Um. And it's and I would like really to to have the opportunity to re discuss some of the. Once you believe need further clarity. So possibly we can introduce you to some of our specialists and I'm sure that by talking to those places especially and focusing really on the few points that you haven't understood so far, we can we can clear out this, this is misunderstanding. So let's reconnect again and go through this this point for further clarity. Thanks. Bye.",2.0
"Hey, Michael, good to see you today. How are you? Yeah, today actually I wanted to talk about the only they leave. That we offer as employer. You know that over the last few years with all this you know change situation around COVID around the the the various situation we have had over the last few years and we have to recognize that things have changed and that. There are many ways new ways of working and also the new generation is really as really changed you know over the last few years. So it's not like the old days I would say where people were really focus on work. I think there is really not much higher focus on the work life balance and I think it would be really, really key to. Reconsider position for the moment possible. Possibly extend the only only two. Do to extend it by by a week so people can can really focus on online balance and also I think we that that could help us to remain competitive on the market and just shoot for you to consider. I think there's a number of studies that have proved that better life balance could be more efficient in terms of productivity so. Let's try to reconnect when you have. Think about that and we will clarify this point.",2.0
"Hey, Michael, have you had time to to consider the proposal I discussed last week about extending only the policies by week? I think it's really, really time to consider that because our competitors are really moving. Customer have similar flexible schedule. So this is really becoming known on the on the market and potentially I'm concerned that that could lead to challenges in recruitment and adding that much needed new talent. We we need to continue expanding our business. So I really believe we need to adopt such policies and surely Community strongly around it. So let's try to make a decision now.",2.0
"Hey Lisa, my name is porticus grave. I just told I take a little bit of time to introduce myself so I'll give you a little bit of background just on my, I guess on my the start of my career, my studies initially where I've been working over the last number of years just to give you a flavor and some kind of an idea of who I am. So as I said, Padraic Cosgrove, born and bred and Dublin. I went to university in Trinity College in Dublin. I studied a course called management science and information system studies four year degree course and after that I left Ireland. That was in the late 80s and there wasn't that many jobs in irons were left Ireland and I spent some time in the UK. So my initial jobs were in trading with banks in the UK and then I moved to New York for a while and after that I left and I came back and I started working in that's my minute up.",3.0
"Hi, Lisa. Let me tell you a little bit about BNY Mellon and I guess some of this is my own personal experience as to why I joined the company recently, four months ago. It's a firm with an incredibly rich history. It's a 238 year old bank and with a really incredible set of products. When I think about BNY Mellon, I think of a custodian with 4343 trillion dollars in assets under custody. Um, we touched 20%. Of the world's investable assets today, our asset under custody actually is about twice the size of the US gross domestic product. We've 2 1/2 trillion dollars worth of payments a day that we make, and we touch just under a third of all our as in the states of meaningful size, that Sarah, is an excess of $1 billion. We're a $300 billion wealth manager today. We're an asset manager with $1.9 trillion of assets under management. Markets franchise is the top ten and foreign exchange trading and one of the world's largest securities lender today with the biggest Dior business, depositary receipt business in the world today and one of the largest collateral managers in the world. And we processed the entire U.S. Treasury market. So that's about $12 trillion on average. Ah, today. So if you think about BNY Mellon, I want to thank you think about. The the breath of our Business Today, it's truly phenomenal. It's not just what we're talking. It's in terms of many, many different services that we can offer you as our relationship, as our relationship grows.",3.0
"Hi, Lisa. I wanna talk to you about one particular part of our Business Today and that's our costly basis. Today our assets under custody stand at $45 trillion. Um that's just to put that in context, $45 trillion is about twice the size of the USG DP to get today. And I don't I think it's important not just to think about our assets under custody in terms of size, but if you think about it from. How we got to that size and why is it where the largest, the world's largest leading custodian today and really that comes down to the rich history and the trust that people place in US today as a custodian. Custody is really all about trust as a 238 year old bank. That's really where we think we excel in terms of giving that trust to our client base and really allowing them then to ensure their assets are safe with us.",5.0
"Hey, Lisa, I just wanted to simplify our value proposition for you. Our value proposition is really centered completely around our clients. You as our client. If what we are doing is not helping our clients, then we are doing something very wrong. If other people within the organization who are not helping me help the clients, then we've got an issue within BNY Mellon. So our focus very much and very simply is around our client base. And how we can improve their processes, their efficiency and their operations, that's where all our focus lies. So when we're talking to you over the last couple of days and explaining our proposition, of course we were talking about many different things in terms of the wider offering. But I think if you think about it in terms of trust and US simplifying your operations and making you more efficient, that's really what I want to focus in on now for the remaining part of our. Edge.",6.0
"Hey, I'd like to talk to you a little bit about our approach as a firm to holidays to paid time off. And I think when I think about this, I think of it I guess how it's transformed this sort of idea around vacation and holiday time in many companies. And certainly when you and I started many years ago, it was very much, here's your 10 or 15 or your day per year as you got more experienced. And it was very, very sad and very rigid. I think now when you look at the workplace and and the generation Z's and the generation whatever coming through, I think they see the world in a different place and and there's a number of different ways companies approach it. I was talking to somebody the other day and they spoke to me about how it's an, it's a top US law firm and how they approach holidays and and there are no holidays in their firm. It's like take as much. Leave as you want, as you feel you need. Now that I think can work, you know, I'm not sure that's perfect because what happens is of course all the associates and the younger people that come through, they feel they shouldn't be taking holidays. And then of course you get into an unhealthy work situation. So I'm thinking more that we should be trying to get our heads around a little bit. Additionally, for people, I think it's important. I think people worked really hard now, I think the days of a. Normal nine to five job that they're gonna effectively. So what's happened is everybody who works there doing an awful lot more than 40 or 50 hours. And I think by giving people this sort of additional week off, additional week of paid vacation leave, I think we will see the return on that 10 fold in terms of the dedication to people, to the company from people and in terms of how we move forward then from that.",5.0
"It's so competitive now, as you know, like trying to keep staff, trying to get the best staff. Are CEOs forever talking about how he wants to make this, this bank, eh institution where people are dying to come to it and there really is an urgency for people to get a job here. So I think we've got to shift the mindset. This isn't really about doing something good for for existing employees. It's really about. About worn maxxing out what we're getting from those employees today in terms of making them really want to work hard for an institution that they admire and their respect. But also it's about making a statement to the marketplace that this is a fantastic place to work with great benefits and with a real interest in Staffs well-being. This is what we're trying to convince people. This is an important decision that people make as to where they go to work. Let's make sure that they want to come here.",5.0
"Good morning, Lisa. My name is Richard Berry. I'm a relationship manager on the alternatives team at BNY Mellon. Um, how are you? Ah, that's very good to hear. What's the weather like over in Connecticut? Well, it's yeah, as per normal, it's pouring with rain here in in in the UK and thank you very much for for making the time to talk to me. I understand that you're looking to convert some alternatives business and yeah, really pleased that you've made set this time aside for me to talk to you. Um.",4.0
"Ah, Lisa. Yes. So thank you for getting in touch with us. Um, I know that you have been speaking to, um, a lot of our peers around alternative services. And I just wanted you to understand, we're very excited to have been given the opportunity to discuss these services with you. And hopefully we can convince you that actually we're one of the leading providers around alternative services. I guess the key for us is. Uh, you know, I I can provide you with a list of our credentials so you can see our size, how experience we are in servicing the alternatives business, but also very conscious that um. For a lot of clients, it's the, the thought of moving any of their businesses is probably one of the most um daunting prospects just from a resourcing perspective. So just wanted you to feel comfortable and know that wherever possible we will take the heavy lifting of any conversion of your business into BNY Mellon. Should we prove to be successful, we will take that burden on on, on your behalf. So just around our own credentials we as you know. Where one of the the may significant providers of alternative services in UM financial services and particularly you're based in the US and structures, we've reviewed them already um prior to the call. Matching in our sweet spot for servicing have a lot of underlying clients equivalent to yourself. So as part of the process would be very happy to answer any questions that you have. And as we take the discussions further, if you'd like to speak to any of our existing clients, would be delighted to make that available to you. Thank you.",3.0
"Hi, Lisa. Yes. And um, yeah, as I was saying, uh, a bit earlier on, so um, as part of our credentials, one of the things I wanted to emphasize was actually the just the significant size of the book of our business. Um, so this is servicing of custody and administration assets. Um. And we currently service in the in the region of 45 trillion of assets, which is as you can imagine is significant. I think the point being made there is that we we would like to assume that that's because we're very good at what we do and the fact that we we have a significant portion of the alternatives market under underground servicing. So yeah, if there's any, as I say, if there's anything more detail around that sort of makeup of that 45 trillion of assets and types of funds, etc, then please just let me know. Thank you.",3.0
"Hi, Lisa. Um, so you mentioned that you find being wise full value proposition and you find that a little bit confusing. Um. How do you find that the proposition confusing?

"Hi, Tim. Um, yeah, thanks for, um, setting aside some time to meet with me. It's a bit of, a bit of a delicate subject, so I thought it be easier if we could meet and just discuss this in face to face in person. So I appreciate that you've been working in finance for over 30 years and it's been very traditional around holiday arrangements and paid leave, etc. But I'm wondering what? Your thoughts are on um, how? Uh lifestyles have evolved and the pressures on people now um and I'm just very conscious and from a number of discussions that I've had with staff you know do more junior staff and actually some more senior staff as well that we haven't really had a had a think about the paid leave and the amount of days that we have as a standard within the company for our employees and just given all of the. Issues that we've experienced over the last few years, it does make me wonder whether now would be a really opportune moment and really as well to try and encourage our retain our staff mass. There's a bit of a staff moving, moving around businesses, etc. As to whether we could consider adding to each person's holiday and paid holiday allowance another five days a year, as I say, I don't think. We visited this this subject properly for the last over the last 1520 years and just very conscious of what we've all been through over the last few years. So what are your thoughts on on that subject? Thank you very much.",3.0
"Oh, that sucks, and I'm really pleased to hear that. You you you approve of that suggestion? Um, what I'll do next then is I will organize a meeting for yourself, um, the head of HR, and I'll attend our coordinate the session and then we can agree with HR as to how we can go through the next part of the process to roll this out and if it's feasible to roll it out. So. Um, leave that with me. I'll set up another meeting. Is that OK with you? Thank you.",4.0
"Hi Lisa. Um I'm so pleased to meet you. Thank you for making time to speak to me. I've heard so much about you from my teams you know during the um yeah although the sessions about our offering and I'm very keen to you know take up and continue the the exchange with you. As you know I'm responsible for the alternatives business in the US and. This is a strategic business for us, so we're very keen to work with you in this space.",3.0
"So, um, as I was saying, the alternatives business is one of our strategic areas and you know we invested significantly into this, into this business. And This is why we are really one of the largest providers as you know. And we, um, yeah, invested specifically in our. Technology, we have one of the state-of-the-art operating platforms and our staff is very experienced with it because with the take on of large clients, we have built a lot of economies of scales, a lot of experience. And this will put you really in a strategy in uh, uh, number one position in the market to acquire more clients and to really focus on your core competencies. Because all of the operational pieces and all of the day today will be taken over from us. So, um, yeah, it will be sufficient for you, your stuff to really do, yeah, you know, your oversight role. But you will be able to focus on your core competencies of, you know, raising, you know, managing the assets and you won't be, um, yeah, you will be able to reduce the resources. That you currently have focused on operational matters. And really this is our core competence here and the experience that we bring to the table will really, um, yeah, bring you a step ahead. And thus we are very keen to partner with you with such a big player and we will also enable you to exchange information with your peers because we have very. Other large clients and we will put you, um, you know, in connection with them.",3.0
"Um, yes, as I was saying. Um. You will appreciate that. Um yeah. With our you know um size we um you know focus a lot on efficiency and um on optimal process is so um if you think about you know our $45 trillion that we have under custody and all of the assets under administration in the alternative space. Um you know, I think this is a testament to. Our positioning in the market and the fact that we have really a state-of-the-art operating model and really will enable you to achieve a lot of quality improvements and also you know the the possibility to process a higher number of transactions and data in a more efficient way. So um, you know I think in the workshops we have. Really dealt with the. The. Yep, we have demonstrated, um, you know how we. Um, yeah, leverage our scale and how all our clients can profit from our um, yes, setup.",3.0
"Yeah, um, I'm really disappointed to hear that. Um, you know, our value proposition hasn't that we haven't been able to clearly outline our value proposition since as I said, this area is really one of our strategic businesses and you know, we should have been able to um. To understand and to propose an operating model that fits your needs, what I would like to propose is that we hold a workshop to review. You know your current setup and to understand better what your requirements are in order to really define, you know the proposed. A model that fits your requirements and needs. Um. You know, often we have the challenge of having so many solutions and so many potential. Um, you know. Yeah, proposals in terms of operating model and service, because we're set up in a modular way and really we can. Built the modules and link them and the systems and interfaces as you require where we see fit you to really fulfill what you need. And I think here there is.",3.0
"Hi. Um, yeah. Thank you for the meeting as you know, um, yeah, the, the topic I'd like to discuss is yes of critical importance, but of course also critical in terms of yeah, of what it will mean. And yeah, I think I, I think you've heard already what it is about that we would like to ask the company to increase the number of paid leave for our, for all employees. And really, there is a lot of um. Yeah, requests coming from staff and mainly due to the reorganization we've had such, um, you know, people have been overburdened with work. They're really stressed out, especially due to the fact that we were understaffed that there's such difficulty to finding stuff. So on one hand I understand that you see this as a critical decision to make because then you know, stuff will be over burned. On the other hand, I think this will motivate people and they will. You know work and be more engaged when they are at work. I think we will you know stuff is or is dedicated. But I think we will get a lot more quality and accuracy and attention in work if we give them this family tie time. And this really fits as well with all the values that we have and with our positioning and work that we do with employees, the values of the company I think it will increase or so. The effort people will put into the additional initiatives like Community Partnerships and other, you know, activities that we, um yeah, expect employees to work on so. So I really would like you to consider this request. Um, I would like you to consider this request and it would also align with the time off that you know people have in other jurisdictions, which are basically defined by law. So it would be I think really a good sign for uh, our staff and it would increase employee engagement and includes satisfaction, which is also a very important measure that we can position to acquire talent in the future.",1.0
"Yeah, so I, um, I understand the challenge from a financial point POV to grant these additional 10 days, but uh, really, we could leverage and use this? Positive way. If we for example you know market use marketing to basically sell it as an additional benefit for BNY, I think we will have an easier time to acquire talent which you know currently we're having a really challenging time and cost is high to get new stuff. So maybe we could start really with three days, five day and see how it goes or limited to a year. And then you know um limited to one year and then you know look at the data and how this you know plays out and if it leads to difficulties in terms of operational efficiencies, I think really that the benefit will be higher than the cost. And you know just like we saw that with the working from home, we were really just as productive and just as efficient and we had a lot of you know. Yeah, good results we would have thought of. I think this measure will also, you know, um. Increase positive positive perception of BNY and the yeah the Prada.",2.0

But our strength is in this diversity and we can. Explain that to you. So just give us some time and will be helpful.",4.0
"Thank you thank you for thinking that the suggestion is a good one Sir so um I was I I know there might be concerns implementing it right away but you know we can we can leave it up to the managers to decide how to you know which Members can plan for the paid leaves at what what time frame for for a few of the teams December and seems to be a fairly. You know, um, holiday kind of. Holiday kind of weak. So even if the employees are not taking the whole week and if if they could be given you know two days apart from the Christmas break it, it would be a good motivation.",4.0
"Hello, Sir. How are you doing? Thank you for meeting me today and I just wanted to you know bring the bring forward the report that we've had from HR for the last two years and and all the brainstorming that we've had with the management teams and the results of it. So as I highlighted earlier, most of our employees have been really stressed and it is visible in, in the outcomes that we are having. So um the research says that for the past two years the employees have not been able to consume their leaves. Because of all the um how how the pandemic has been. So the general you know consensus that we've had in the meeting was to give an extra week of paid holiday to our employees for the year 2022. Um it would be really great if you could you know, consider this in in your plan and give a weeks holiday to the employees please.",4.0

So I'm looking forward to present the services and our proposal to you so. It'll be good catching up.",4.0
"Hello, today I will be talking about a very exciting framework that is going to change the way that we are looking at the category of not just beer but drinks overall. So the landscape is changing quite a bit. We are seeing that. Just five years ago, 10 years ago, it was a decision between hard alcohol, wine or beer, but that's changed completely. We now see that there's new entrance that are blurring the category, so things like hard seltzers. Um. Ready to drink cocktails and these things are taking the share from beer. So we need to be thinking about our category outside of just our immediate competitors, but all of the brands and all the products that are competing with us. The category is also having accelerating innovation. Um, not just those RTD and um RTD cocktails and hard seltzers, but also things like CBD drinks. Um and cannabis drinks. Those are also coming into the the category as well. So we need to be thinking about the category the way our consumers are thinking about the category. And this isn't just based on fear, but products that meet their needs overall. An example of how to think about this is travel. If you're an airline, you don't want to just be thinking about other airlines, but instead thinking about um. Other modes of transportation like trains, cars, rental cars as your competition as well. So we are going to be looking at the category from the context of how we can meet consumers needs overall. So thinking about in specific occasions what type of consumer needs emerge and what type of product or category would be able to meet those needs and that's going to open us up. To thinking more broadly about our competition.",4.0
"Today I will be walking you through how to pour the perfect poured from a draft for a Heineken beer. So you're going to take a Heineken glass and you're going to rinse it out with water, making sure that the glass is cold and clean before you start to pour. Once the glasses nicely rinsed, you're going to place the glass at a 45 degree angle under the spout. But before you start pouring, it's important to keep in mind that the spout should never be touching the glass or the beer. Um, because that can make the beer dirty. Or the pipes. In the spout dirty as well. So you're going to pull the handle from the bottom up, not from the top, because that could break off the handle. Um, you're going to pour the beer at a 45 degree angle until the beer hits the top corner of the glass, and then you're going to straighten the glass out and finish pouring. Once the beard hits the top of the glass, we're going to shut off the spout and you're going to place the glass down. Very important and special to Heineken. Is you're going to take a wet skimmer, skim off the top um to lock in the head of the beer, and you're going to check to see if the head of the beer lines up with the horizontal arms of the star on the front of the glass, and if so, that means you have a perfect for.

But Sicily offers a wide variety of locations and destinations, landscapes and foods that are unspoiled by the tourist industry. It has beach towns like the Malfi coast, including Memphi and Armina.

"My name is Joe Conti, and today I'm going to be talking to you about the best way to prepare pasta with pesto, given that it is late September. Being at time to harvest the basil plants that you've been growing all summer, this is the primary ingredient in your pesto. So step one will be to pick the basil from the garden, making sure that every leaf that you use is into damaged from rot or insects. Make sure that you pick the basil from the base, because these plants are not going to come back in the winter, so it's important that you harvest the whole plant. You can take those plants inside, wash them, inspect them for this, for the rot and other damages. And pick the most pristine leaves to make the sauce. Um, rather than measurements for the sauce, IT measurements will depend on the density and size of the leaves, so we're going to talk about making everything to taste in a food processor. It's important that you planned the basil with olive oil. Salt and pepper parmesan cheese, as well as a roasted nut. It's not essential that you use pine nuts. Um, beat that. They are quite expensive. You can substitute for roasted walnuts or pistachios. What is important though is that you toast them because if they're raw. The basil will come out with a squishy content consistency. Cooking the pasta is important. When we talk about Al dente, it's important that the pasta is cooked in the pot, not to a point where it's totally ready to eat. It could be a little bit crunchy because the important part to make the pasta creamy is to extract the pasta from the pot, strain it, save some of the water so that you can put it in a pan with the almost cooked pasta water and pesto in order to. Stir vigorously and make the pasta creamy and ready for consumption.",4.0

We did not have a lot of um paid days off, but I think the company is a hold will benefit from this tremendously in terms of talent retention because a lot of the staff are overworked. We have to deliver accordingly to client expectations. So if we do increase number of days that are paid for for our staff. Um, to relax and to take some time off to themselves. I think they will be also happier, more satisfied with the company, and also there will be more productive as they can work full force and deliver a lot of a lot more value to the firm.",4.0
"Thank you. I'm very happy to hear that you liked the idea. And you see there are three open racks that we have been struggling to feel. So I think if we increase our paid time off, it's gonna, um, create an additional um. Influence and will be able to hire staff easier because our competitors cannot match that level of paid time off. Um, in addition to us being able to fill the open racks easier. Our current employees will also benefit from that, again as I mentioned that. Ah, there. They work around the clock, they work weekends. So they really do need to have that additional time off to recharge to ensure that they deliver the past service, the best value for our clients as well as. Care of their own, mental, physical health. They need some time to themselves. Thank you.",2.0

"So one of my favorite vacation destinations is actually very close to home. It's in New Jersey at the Jersey Shore. Reason I think it's a great vacation spot to recommend is because one it's it's close to major cities and Philadelphia, NY. It's a 2 hour or less drive to get there means you can make more frequent trips and it's always within reach during the summertime. It also has everything you need. From my perspective, it's as great white sand beaches. Warm ocean water in the late summer months and then great bars and restaurants to go out to on the weekends and really disconnect from work and the work week, but still be close to make it back. Um, make frequent trips to and from during the summertime.",
"I believe the one thing that's going well currently the workplace is, and I think it's an emergency after the pandemic, is the flexibility to work remote and work from home when needed. This this allows for more work to be done outside the office, more flexible hours if there are other other commitments that you have throughout the week to be able to work. Not the typical 9 to 5 schedule which is really great I think on the opposite side of that. So one thing that could be improved with the current workplace condition. Is is having, um togetherness with colleagues. I think that's missed a lot when you have a lot of remote working situations or and virtual meetings is really being together with with other employees, celebrating successes and enjoying each others company which was. The normal before the pandemic.",5.0

And then they walk to work. Typically there and back is 1000 steps each way and then throughout the day in the office walking around as well as after work at home, another 3000 steps there.

Understand how we will get product over, over the ocean, through seafreight issues into the US um, so we've done is as we're launching the product, we started first by looking at our initial forecasts, sales forecast and adding an extra 20% of volume to ensure that we have enough bond coming over and plan just in case there is some volatility and overall forecasts. 2nd we looked at the shipment timings and with long lead times on the water we and we decided to. Front load, a lot of the volume so that we have almost 40% of the volume coming over in the first three months of launch to ensure that we have it in warehouses and ready to sell to consumers. And 3rd in order to make adjustments on the fly, we have set up a system of constant. Re forecasting and adjustments to be made on a weekly basis that we can adjust forecasts, adjust supply planning to ensure that we have enough product and there aren't any issues without a stocks or product being stuck on in ocean freight over the water.

"Hi, Lisa. It's really nice meeting you today. How long have you worked at the company for? OK, about five years. And have you always been based in Canada, I mean in Connecticut? Oh no. OK.

"Lisa, so I I really think um converting your business on to BNY Mellon would be really good fit for you. And I I know that's what everyone saying that you're talking to out in the market that they can handle your alternatives business and we can handle it to um something different though they were bringing to the table is allowing you to make data and asset and we really understand that the alternatives data itself is just one small component of what you're doing. On daily basis and it's really about using data as an asset and being able to leverage that. As part of our alternatives platform, we also provide a data platform and this data platform allows you to take all of the BNY Mellon data that we would be providing on your behalf and bringing that together in your own platform where you can bring other datasets throughout your organization, maybe even with other vendors. And we understand you have other vendors as well where you can bring all that data together and do analysis on the data. And what this really then does is it makes it an asset for you to go and analyze the markets, be able to see how your. Doing from an investment standpoint, maybe as an example, you want to go and take all of your alternatives data. Maybe you're invested in malls. You can even bring in mall traffic, foot traffic. Compare that to how your investments are looking and see if things are on a rise, on a fall. Think about how that could have worked when we were going through kovid and looking at all of your investments in seeing how they're tracking. So what this really allows you to do is not just, hey will handle your tentative data, but we're going to give you that data and allow you to make something of it.",3.0
I am extremely confident that we can handle your business. BNY Mellon has over 45 trillion assets under custody and or administration where extremely prepared to be able to take on your trillions of dollars in assets under management. We have experience doing it. We've gone in the past 10 years from 20 trillion to 45 trillion. We're seeing a lot of um the market go towards us and we're prepared to handle your business as well. And we look forward to the opportunity.,5.0
"I can definitely understand why are full value proposition can be confusing. We're doing something different than others are out in the market that you've been talking to. As I mentioned earlier, one of our differentiators is the ability to gain value from your data and the data platform that we've put below that isn't just meant for BNY Mellon data like others. We're looking to bring other datasets outside of BNY Mellon that we know you have to meet your needs. Then bring all that data together and allow you to gain insights from that. So to be clear, we're not looking to be to hold you to just being why we know there's other important data out there. We know you're not just using BNY Mellon, but we're giving you a warehouse to take all of that data to gain insights and value from.",5.0
"Hi, skip. I was wondering if I could come in and talk to you about our employee satisfaction initiatives that we have going on. Um, as you know, it's been a little bit of a challenge to get employees to come back to the office and we know that we're losing others to our competitors and the initiatives really about looking to make our workforce more happy, um and and feel more connected with with our organization. After um sending out some surveys to UM employees, one of the things that we're hearing is looking for more flexibility when it comes to vacation. We think in looking at that. That by adding one more week of paid time off or holiday time that this would allow um, our workforce to be more flexible with the time that's spent and also appreciate the organization more. So this will help with retention also based on our polling and looking at them, it's not about using all of the five weeks and some of our employees have said they wouldn't even use all of it. It's just about having the. Ability to use it if they need to. This is going to keep them from feeling constrained, always needing to be working. They'll come back fresh, they'll feel more flexible, and I really think by giving them a little bit of extra time they won't feel like they're constantly working and will add more value to our firm. So I think it's something that we should really talk about and think about implementing.",4.0
"I definitely understand your hesitancy for adding five more days of vacation for everyone, but I really think today. Everyone has what they need to be able to work from home, and they're constantly working from when they wake up to when they go to bed. And what we're seeing is that even though they're on a vacation there, still working, we have a mobile device. They're able to answer everything. There's still being productive even though they're possibly on vacation. On top of that, when talking to the employees, they may not even take all five weeks. It's just about having that flexibility to do so, and what will create is the happiness. That we want them to have and the appreciation for the organization. So while I know it is a big change for us to be able to do that, I think the pros outweigh the cons on this one and the happiness that we would get in the differentiation that we have within the market would be really appreciated.",5.0

"Good morning, Dave. Hope all is well with you it how's your family doing? It's been awhile since we've gotten together. Um, I wanted to discuss that idea that I've been thinking about, you know, recently just around our employee retention. As you know, we've been seeing an uptick and employee resin resignations within our various teams. Um, in recent months, we're losing valuable talent within our organization, which is causing stress on our existing teams as well as you know, decreasing our productivity. Um, so all of that, um, you know, got got me to thinking, what could we do? So you know, as you know, the industry is changing, employees are looking for more flexibility, additional benefits, and my attempt at being creative, I was thinking about adding additional paid time off. What are you thoughts about expanding the vacation policy and adding an extra week? Of vacation time to to the staff. You know, we can structure it in multiple ways. Um, but, you know, maybe adding the week after, um, after a year of service. But we can, you know, again, we can take time to discuss the details about it. You know, I'm thinking that the additional vacation will incentivize the staff, give them greater flexibility, encourage a better work life balance experience for them. You know, art. Or our teams will feel like our company values them and cares about their well-being. It'll improve our morale and lead to additional employee retention. What are your thoughts?",4.0
"David, I'm happy to hear that you're considering this option of additional time off for employees. The additional time off will give us an opportunity to attract better talent, increase employee retention, improve morale and increase our productivity and and it also gives our employees better tools for planning and and also us as an organization. People can schedule their appointments and we won't have those last minute sick days and then we're scrambling to get the work done because you know, again, people aren't prepared for people to be out. So, um, you know, again, I, I keep going back to it. It's going to foster a better work life balance for everyone and we will gain by continuing to have happy employees and retaining them. You know, everyone says talks about the additional time off um in Europe and this will help bridge that gap. So what do you think we need to do to move this forward?",4.0

Was a significant other? That's great. That's great to hear. I'm sure the one thing we probably agree on is you probably missed the weather, right, the sunshine versus the cold and rain on the east.

And also just to share some of my experiences with the team and resourcing constraints that everyone is under and strained from uh day, Day today working environment and some concerns I'm hearing with the staff.

And and real estate portfolios, we've been in business for over 15 years. We have close to 50 trillion under assets under management. Our clients are not only with us because of our fund administration business, because of the benefits that they get from their broader BNY Mellon franchise such as our custody model, which was born out of the credit crisis in 2008. So we do have a custody model. It leverages the same exact infrastructure as our traditional custody model, with one main difference. We have a high touch. Client service. Day-to-day operational oversight whereby instead, uhhh, instead of having to e-mail a group of individuals and waiting for someone to come back to you, you get a dedicated point of contact now. With your business, which is extremely high volume, extremely complicated with lots of corporate actions and wire activity, this would alleviate some of the pain in terms of waiting, trying to figure out who is coming back to you and trying to work your way through what I would call a group e-mail address. So again, this high touch costing model is another reason why are alternatives business is growing because they're looking to US versus the competition in terms of. Faster turn around time.",5.0

"Michael, you and I have both been working in this industry for over 25 years. I know I can remember when I first started out and I had a total of 10 days vacation and was trying to figure out which of those 10 days when I was taking them within the calendar year. The industry has evolved a lot in the last 25 years. One of the key areas for us in terms of recruitment. Is what our overall offering is. In terms of health insurance? Time off. And work flexibility. We are constantly competing with thin tech companies. Um for talent? And I believe as someone who's been on campus attempting to recruit. The next generation of employees, that being my melon. That these individuals are looking for the flexibility in terms of work life balance. We also know that whether you get 10 days, 15 days. 20 days or 25 days, the reality is. Many of us don't take all those days. That being said, when we are comparing ourselves against our direct competition as well as the new. Entrance in competition such as these fintech companies, they are offering anywhere from 30. To 40 days. Of paid time off. It is something we should really consider because it'll allow us and it will open the doors for a whole new group. Of talent.",7.0

And our operating model, we try to hire the most talented individuals in the seat. We have a global operating model.

"Good morning. Thanks for taking time out of your day to meet with me. I'd like to have a discussion with you about the idea of expanding. Paid time off by one week. I'll break it down into 3 categories. The first COVID and its impact, the second quality of work. And the third, the importance of retaining our best workers. COVID it's put a strain on all of us. We were forced to move from the office back home, and in doing so, there are many challenges that come with that. Kids are running around during meetings, during video calls. Um, and we may have to answer questions during video calls about homework or food and were also forced to help take care of our loved ones if they get sick. So let's put an additional strain on all of us. It's been exhausting. Secondly. Quality of work. We've seen now over two years of working remotely, that quality of work has not suffered and the job is getting done. In fact, we I'm finding that people are working longer hours than they used to. This might be primarily driven because they're avoiding, uh, commute. But the job is getting done. And lastly, retaining our best workers. Our best workers want some extra time off, deserve some extra time off because they're expanding their work day, starting early in the morning, working till late in the evening. Work is just down the hallway now. It's easy to answer emails at 11:00 o'clock at night. I'm asking you, please, to help retain our best workers. Continued improvement in quality of work to expand our time off.",5.0
"I see you're not totally convinced about my pitch for an extra week off paid. I'd like to ask you, do you consider me a good employee? Do you consider me a productive employee? Am I a culture carrier? Uh, leader here at the firm? Yes, I agree. I'm all those things. I can comfortably handle my work. Not only handle it, but excel at it. I'm at risk of burning out right now. And you're at risk of losing me, and I'm not alone. I would talk to people in the hallways. And I can tell you that more people think this way as well. Once your best employees leave, your BI level employees will follow them and you'll be left with C level employees. Please consider extending the paid time off. You'll feel, will feel appreciated and will be rested to give our best. Thank you.",5.0

And doing something once a week is like actually the most perfect because it gives me time to think about things. What am I going to change next week? So I'll talk about my current process. If we're going to have pizza on Saturday night, I actually make the dough on Thursday. So I weigh out all the ingredients for the dough will come all the. Details of it, but um if you know bakers percentages, I like to do a 66% hydration dough. I then let the proof for an hour and then move it into the fridge. It sits in the fridge Thursday to Friday and then on Friday I actually I make it up into small bowl small balls that are going to actually form the pizzas. Then come Saturday I have a. Small propane fired pizza oven out of my back porch, but take out the dose about two or three hours before I prepared the sauce, which is actually just canned tomatoes in little olive oil. I get the cheese and whatever toppings I'm going to get ready. Um. I prepared the dusting flowers that I make once the ovens heated up. It takes about 15 minutes or 20 minutes to heat up. Um. I prepped the pizzas by stretching them. I don't do the whole tossing in the air, I just gently hold it inside my hands and stretch out the dough. Um. Again, it makes small pizzas like individual pizzas about 1012 inches across. I dust the wooden pizza, peel with semolina flour and put on the tomato sauce, the cheese and then cook it in the oven for about 3 minutes.",5.0
"OK, so I'm going to make the argument for the staycation. I think a high quality staycation at home where you relax, you're able to catch up on reading and. Movies and other media that you life just doesn't allow you to get to. Is. Significantly more refreshing than. Most vacations, I think that summer absolutely, completely special, especially if you're going to travel very, very far. And see something for the first time, but I have really come to appreciate a high quality recharging staycation at home. I know it's not for everyone, but I think that it is. It's it's been a very meaningful journey for me recently.",
"OK, so two things about my workplace, both related to the fact that it's an open office plan. The first is that it has been a lot of fun post COVID to be able to just wheelchair over and discuss an issue or problem or chat through something small without using slack. It's very refreshing to be able to talk in person in the open plan that way. To that same end it is. It can be very difficult and it's been. Something that my team has mentioned to me that it's very hard to get heads down time and get work done in the open floor plan. It's very, very noisy. It's very distracting. Even just having people walk behind you can be really hard for people who are trying to write code, and I totally appreciate that. And we are working on a solution of trying to find either a quiet zone or quiet times so that they can get their work done.",5.0
"I want to share two ideas with you. One that on an average day a person takes 7500 steps and produces 4 pounds of garbage. And what I think is interesting there is too. Understand that a small difference in a day has such a huge impact over the course of a year. 7500 steps a day is over two and two and three quarter million steps per year. And. 4 pounds of garbage today is almost. Almost 2 tons of garbage in the course at one time of garbage in the course of a year. And so if you think about it, if you were to if you wanted to increase your steps, a small increase multiplied over all those days would have a huge impact over the year. Likewise, if you could reduce your garbage Even so slightly, it could really reduce the impact of your garbage.",4.0
"Hello. I began my career as a web developer in 2000. I worked at an art gallery in Soho, and I was actually doing manual labor. I built crates and shipped artwork around the country and around the world. It was 2000 and the web was very new and. The gallery wanted website and so I volunteered. To. Build the website for the gallery. It was. It was an adventure. It was. Very successful and it became my full time position at the gallery. I. When I left that role of the gallery, I immediately went into freelance web development and did that for another. 15 years. And then during that time is when I met Richard Brooklyn in and began working for Brooklyn and transferring them from a Kickstarter to Shopify. Uh. The. Ah, precluded by the. By position continued to transform, and then eventually as the company grew, it became apparent that we needed other software developers on the team supporting the website. And so I moved into a management position at Brooklyn in. Oh, I have to speak for at least 100 seconds. So I began my management career at Brooklyn, and I have now the Director of Software Development. At Brooklyn um.

"Today I am going to be talking to you about making a Sunday gravy. And yes, it's gravy. So the most important thing about making a Sunday gravy meal is around the meat products that you are cooking in the gravy. So most families will start by making meatballs, which I certainly prefer a mix of veal, beef, and pork in my meatball mix. Along with a number of other ingredients including the basic salt, pepper, parsley, bread crumbs, and parmesan cheese. You should be seeing those off in olive oil and removing them from the pot. Then you should see her off any additional meats that you would like to include in your Sunday gravy. Um, once you've seared off all of your meats, it's important to then add in some onion and possibly garlic and brown those up a little bit in olive oil and then you can re add your meats and your tomatoes. I personally like adding in whole tomatoes. Um, then you can crush those tomatoes while they're in the sauce. It's important to let your sauce simmer for as long as possible before serving it, and you should never you should never be shy on the amount of salt that you are adding to your sauce. Um, I once took a cooking class with famous chef and Burrell and we made a Sunday gravy with her and the amount of salt that she put in or recommended was. A shocking amount. Literally handfuls of salt in a large pot of gravy. So that is where I learned to never be shy, and then you can certainly add in other. Other items as you wish.",5.0
"Hi, my favorite vacation destination is Hawaii. I had the pleasure of recently going this past summer. I think Hawaii offers a great variety of activities along with relaxation.

"So this question is around what is going well in the workplace today and what is something that can be improved upon. I think it's a very timely question as we have all recently become begun returning to the office on a more regular basis. What's going well is absolute camaraderie. I think the thing that attracts people to employment at Pershing and my melon is the length of time that we've worked here and the family culture I've had the pleasure of working with many people. On my teams for more than 20 years and it's really good to see those faces again and connect with them on a more personal level. And rather than just video conferencing, um, I still think there are things that can be worked on the collectively, there is a prioritization challenge.

"Hello, Mike. Um, thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. I wanted to take her an opportunity to run something past due. Um, as you can see, um, we've been looking at productivity, um, especially in the last couple of years with the pandemic. And what we found is that people are working a lot harder. And even though we're pushing, you know, to work smarter, I think we need to recognize some of the employees. Um, time that has encroached. Where traditional working day would mean they finish, get on a train, go home, people are working longer days are and there's familiar commitments as well that you know are more at the forefront today. So what I was thinking and looking to propose is maybe extending time off and leave. For our employees by a week. It may sound a lot, um, initially, but let's look at the productivity and the time people are putting in. And see what's reasonable and I think you'll find a weak case. We've done some initial analysis, more than happy to share that with you, talk you through it and get your input and then we can take it from there. So if I can schedule some time with you in the next couple of weeks just to follow up with the analysis and what our findings are and also to engage our as well or on protocol and how we could approach this. And do let me know other factors you'd like me to consider prior to come back. Back to you in a couple of weeks with our findings, but it's something I think that we need to address and it would be of interest and really would help employee morale and productivity.

Um, if you let me know what errors concern you, then at least I can go away and address. Emm. And if we can't address them, we can talk through how we best approach it and is there a middle ground and solution we can look at. But I really do appreciate your time.

And really understands the needs of your investors because that's who's most important in this business right there. Investors that are looking for a lot of data, they're looking for timeliness and accuracy, and you need to be able to deliver that to them. And the provider that you choose for as your custodian and administrator is critical to that. So we've been on a journey for several years now. We set out our plan and we've really feel that strongly that we've executed on that plan and we're we're really the right partner for you. You know, I feel strongly that the size and scale of your business you need to now kind of think about, you know, I've had this boutique provider that has been great at helping me get to where I am today, but they're clearly running into some challenges and you know we feel strongly that you know will match really well with your organization and where the best partner for you to continue to grow and scale your business right now.

"Alright Tim so thank you so much for for meeting with me today. I know you feel very strongly about this topic and you know it's one that's near and dear to you. You've obviously you know been at at our company for for over 30 years and you've you know helped it grow and you're one of the most dedicated people I've ever met for sure and and and hard working and you know you're you're you're always kind of in the office and you put the company first which is incredibly. Um, Admiral, Admiral, and I know this one is a bit controversial for you. You know, obviously increasing holiday and vacation time by a week. Um, it's a significant investment. It's going to be a big change for our company, but I feel like we're at a turning point right now. And. We really need to do something about it. Um, Tim, um, you know, I'm seeing that you know historically our employees have gotten between two and three weeks of time off a year depending on seniority obviously and you know that's that's obviously great and something that has worked for us in the past, but. We've done an industry analysis and and our competitors are at three to four weeks and it seems like you know our employees with the increased turnover rate, they're looking for that additional time off. They're incredibly dedicated. I could see the energy and passion in their work, but it feels like people have tried to jump ship and this is almost turning into a bit of a snowball effect and I feel like we need to stop it right now. Um, to make sure that the company thrives into the future. You know, you've you've helped build this, this Organism organization and we certainly want it to last and thrive well into the future. I think giving people an extra week of time off is going to boost morale so much and really make people want to really use that. I'm in the office as best they can. And again, put the company 1st just like you have. So I hope you can consider it. Thank you.",3.0
"Hey, Tim, thanks. Thanks so much again for for your time to meet again on on this topic. I I was really happy to see your note that you're much more open to the to the conversation, the idea of increasing vacation, but you um you still have some reservations and obviously it's a big change. So I I fully understand. But can you can you share a little bit more about your thoughts after our last conversation and what that reservation is? OK, I understand. So sort of summarize, you feel that you know general there's alot of things that can cause employees saleeby don't feel that increased vacation time is going to be enough of a needle mover that would cause employees to leave and start way that we've always done it that that generally, right, OK. I, like you know, I think we've had the benefit of time since our last meeting. It's been a few weeks since we've connected and um, I know you know that we've implemented these great pecan surveys for our employees to make sure that they are satisfied with their work. And you know, it's interesting. We actually added question in there to ask our employees whether they feel that they have enough time to rest and recharge during the year to perform at their optimal state. And the results were very, very telling. Tim, 91% of respondents said they did not, and it was interesting. These questions do have additional comments sections and there was a lot of comments from people that they would benefit from increased.",4.0
"Hi, I'm Katie. I'm the CEO of flip turn. And today I'll be telling you what the product I work on does and how we help commercial fleets. So first I'll start with the problem that our product solves and then I'll follow it up with a solution that we provide. So first, our product helps commercial vehicle fleets. These are collections of vehicles, include trucks, vans, any vehicle owned by a commercial entity. A lot of these fleets are looking to adopt electric vehicles, but they run into some blockers along the process. They're worried that the vehicles won't have enough range called range anxiety. They don't know how they're going to charge these vehicles. And third, they don't know how they're going to fit these new vehicles into a budget. That's built around diesel trucks and paying for fuel. So flip turns solves these problems in three main ways. The 1st way is we help these fleets reason about how to fit electric vehicles into their budget with our total cost, total cost of ownership modeling tool. This ingests real fleet data and shows fleets concretely there year over year cost and how it changes as they electrify. Second, we offer a government rebate analytics tool. This helps fleets understand how the possible rebates that are out there could impact their budget and their total cost of ownership of their vehicles, and it helps them understand which rebates they might be eligible for. And then third, we provide a charger planning tool which helps fleets understand, one, which chargers are the right fit for them and their operations, and two, how much they should expect to pay and charging fees. So by by presenting these three pieces of information concretely, we help them reason through their transition.",5.0
"Hi, today I'll be teaching you how to make macarons. Macarons are cookies that are really popular. They're crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside sandwich cookies and will be covering how to make them in four main phases. The first phase is the prep, second phase is mixing, third phase is the rest phase, and then finally the bake phase. So first, the prep. The most important thing for making macarons is to have everything measured out beforehand, and to have all the tools that you need set up beforehand. Making a macaron is all about using the right tools and being prepared, so first measure out all your ingredients using a food scale. This will increase include measuring out the correct amount of powdered sugar, measuring out the correct amount of almond flour, the correct amount of granulated sugar. ETC. Second, set out all your tools and make sure you're ready to go. This will include heating of food processor, needing a KitchenAid mixer, and meeting your scale. Um. After you measure everything out, next is time to mix everything together. So first, you know, mixed the flowers together. Next, mix beat your egg and. Form it into stiff peaks, mixing to let you form stiff peaks, then mix the dry ingredients into the wet. After everything is mixed, then comes the rest phase. So this involves piping the mixture into circles and then letting it rest on the table for 40 minutes. Lastly is the bake. You bake it for 20 minutes and then you're done.",5.0

It's likely less in areas where driving is the primary form of transportation. So if you're living in a suburb, or you're living in an area where typically you commute long distances into work, typically that will involve taking less steps. During the day, if you're in a metropolitan area where you are taking public transportation or even walking the entire distance to work, likely you're tallying a higher number of steps per day. Regardless of the number of steps per day, it's important to get in that activity so that you are living a healthy lifestyle, whether it's through walking or through other forms of exercise.",6.0

And since it's football season, that's going to be smoked BBQ ribs and we're going to be talking about using it or smoking BBQ ribs on a charcoal grill. So the first thing that we want to do is we want to get our charcoal over crap. Burke Burke at we want to do a minion method. What that simply means is we want to put the charcoal and the chimney starter and create a nice diameter of a whole so when we put the hot charcoals in. The fire spreads out evenly. You can use whatever rub that you want to use, I personally. Go to the Amazon or wherever store or find a good rub. Try out the rugs, maybe write a good review, and then I go to Sam's Club or Costco. They have a criar cryovac 3 pack of baby back ribs. That's what I choose. If you choose to use Saint Louis ribs or spare ribs, totally up to you. But what you want to do is you want to get a nice washer sauce, I call it to W sauce. You want to layer that on your on your ribs and make sure that you get that on both sides. Nice and even. I keep the membrane off on the bottom side is the fat. Capital. See that? Some people take that off. I'll leave it on its flavor for me. And then you want to get your rub on there. Nice, nice and even on both sides while the fire is going. Once that's going, you want to have your fire set to about. You want to have your temperature set to about 2:25 to 50. Layout the ribs on you wanna come and once the ribs are on, it's going to take about 3 1/2 four hours to cook. Some people cook at 6 hours. I found about 3 1/2 four hours ago. It's the optimal cooking time for me. Um, every hour you want to check it looking at, looking at cooking. So you want to make sure that you know you have the top down. Every hour you want to make sure you're sprinting with some apple juice. You take it off after 3 1/2 hours. It should come to like a Nice 90 degree bend there that lets you know the ribs already.

"Good afternoon, everybody. Uh, first of all, thanks Tracy for that insightful session on the future of requirement.

So the topic that I'm going to talk about today is digital logistics platform which is called axper move. So first of all I would like to explain you what is move. Movers basically in distal logistics platform which provides end to end automation process for the logistics requirements in the Siemens world. But I think the bigger question that we want to. Answer and would like to know is. Why we need move? Uh. And. To answer to that question, there would be a couple of points that I would like to mention to you can.",
"Thank you, Tracy. That was a really great session on future of procurement and I think it was really insightful. And once again, good afternoon, everybody. Today I'm going to talk about a very important topic and which is very close to myself because I have been working on this project for a long time. This is called. X4 move, which is basically a digital logistics platform. I will explain more in detail what is X or move. So X or move is a digital logistics platform which is an end to end service provider and it's basically. Automated process which solves all the Siemens logistics requirements. Uh, the other main question that we would like to understand is why we need move. To answer this question, I would like to use some of the examples. Of the mean example is that today we have a lot of different tools that we use. We use tools for global rate card, we used tool for spot by process, we use tool for ordering process as well. So this end to end process automated tool. We want to make sure that we use one tool for all these functionalities. Another reason being. We have quite bigger invoicing issues that we would like to solve, so we want to make sure and capture the information up front in this platform so that we don't have any problem with the forwarders they don't if they don't put the correct information and we should reject their invoices. Another bigger reason why we need movers we don't have a good great data transparency today. We have to rely kind of 100% on the forwarders reports so that we can see how much volume that we have, how much spend that we had with XYZ and forwarders. Although we do get our internal ports but still to get more detail into shipment level kind of information we have to rely on the data we get from the forwarders. Couple of other important point is basically the optimal supplier selection. We have our approved and preferred forwarders which has been selected through a supplier qualification process where the ******** tendering process has been done. So it is very, very important that we use that process to make sure we're using the right supplies. So that's one of the intention. When we use this platform, we see the options which are better for us. Not only from the price perspective, but also from the service perspective. Also the spot by functionality if we talk about. This is also one of the key initiatives that we have been. We have taken from the tool that. If a user is not getting any options from the tool that which forwarded to use, he doesn't look too. Need to look outside. He can use this part by functionality within the tool to go out and send the request to the selected forwarders. And one of the key important feature that I want to mention here is the CO2 emissions to reduction analytics. Today we don't know what is our carbon footprint. You don't know. Hubbard Shooter adduction we can achieve what is the CO2 mission that we have, so that's also something we are trying to capture. In this platform we will have an X or visit dashboard which will not only tell you which are the best route is to use which is the cheapest folder to use, but it will also tell you which is the greener folder to use, which means you can make a decision. Based on the CEO to mission, not only based on the price and the service.

"Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this digital mind session. My name is Emma, and I'm going to be your moderator today. And. Um. We were going to start off with an introduction as to what this session is all about and what the following sessions will be. I'm sure you're all eager to know, and, um, I'm eager to get to know all of you as well because the groups will continue to work together, so it'll be great if we begin to learn a little bit more about each other. So we will start today with a bit of an icebreaker and after that has finished we will then go on to describe what digital minds actually is all about. And after you've got, um, a grasp of that, you might then have some questions. So we'll leave some time for that and then we're going to move on to our first exercise of the day. We will take regular breaks throughout the day. I understand if some of you do need to move off to go and take comfort break, that's fine. Um. But then I would encourage you to try and stick to the allocated break so that we get the most possible out of our sessions together. So, um, onto the ice breaker though. We will have a little, um, if you could all sorry. If you could navigate to your concept boards please, you would have received the link in your welcome pack. And um, if you follow the link through to the let's meet session. You should find or being well, that you have a box on there with your name above it. If you could find the box with your name, grab yourself a couple of posts dates from the concept board. If anybody isn't quite sure how to use the concept board then just raise your hand in teams um and I'll see if I can get you unstuck to get you moving. Just take your two post-its, stick them onto your name, and in one of the post it's if you could write something that is true about yourself that you don't think anybody else would know already, and also write something that is a lie. Um. And what we'll do is we will go through everybody and everybody else has to guess which is the lion, which is the truth, just so we can get to know each other a little bit better and to have a little bit of fun as well, because that is very important, so. If anybody has any difficulty with using the Post-its on the concept board or accessing concept board, just raise your hand now. In teams, I'll keep an eye on their. So it seems like we're all good to go. Nobody raised their hand yet, so that's perfect. Let's make a start then. Yes, I can see that some people are already completing their post-its. I can see some quite amusing comments already. Not sure whether they're true, whether they're false, but we'll find out soon enough. OK, that's wonderful. Just a couple more to go. Fabulous. Thank you all so much for filling that in. So if we if we start off, then with Janet, if you'd like to read out yours, please. And the group can decide whether they think it is true or false. Once we've got through the whole group we will move on to the next part of the day, so the first exercise for today. In our agenda is to navigate down to the, UM, activity one on the concept board. I'll take control of the board here so I can show you where we're heading to.",5.0

"So I'm going to talk a little bit today about my journey post digital mind. Um, we sat digital mind back in about 18 months ago actually. And um. Yeah, I wanted to make or give a little bit of a tangible example and as to what, what's happened? Postage to mine. So as you're all aware and one of the challenges within the digital mind app is how to create an application in less than 3 hours and that's using eh, no code application called mendix. Now for those of you don't know what mendix is, it's a. Part of the the NO code low Code Revolution, shall we say, um, you know, it allows the likes of you and I have perhaps got kind of a professional role within an organization and who perhaps have have ideas to create apps or web applications or mobile applications to. Um, use basic rules in in plain English and and logic to create and bring their application to life. So. Um. Or post completing and developing a pin in under 3 hours course by mendix. But we actually did is took an idea that we had internally within our procurement team. That idea was such that you know we had a supplier collaboration process previously. You know we're having these fantastic conversations with with some of our suppliers and on, on kind of how we look to, to create a strategic development plan with those supplies. And essentially what we didn't have was it was a cloud based problem, the cloud based platform to actually capture all these ideas and strategic objectives. So what myself and a couple of colleagues within the team looked to do is bring this idea, this concept to life through through the Mendix platform. And so we set out initially to um to create a bit of a specification, what's called user stories. So we created a list of maybe 20 to 25 user stories that we could then work with the GBS mendix team to develop. Um. Also had those user stories we actually um. Sprinted, um the 1st and 2nd what are known as minimum viable products. So we handle the user stories over to development team they developed what we'd actually put in place and and then essentially what happened is you know they presented the iterations in the various formats to us and we looked at the various tweaks that we needed to um to put in place and the final outcome was really fantastic cloud based platform that both Siemens employees stroke colleagues and. Could engage with, but also, and perhaps most importantly, um. Our external supply base, UM, could actually access in the cloud. So at any point in time, they can log into the collaborate platform, as it is aptly known and they can look at objectives or get their actions, put things like it and productivity measures in there, etc. And it also has a really generalized overview of how that partnership is functioning. So yeah, really today was just to give a bit of a tangible example of how perhaps the general Siemens population can kind of put a little bit of time in. On the back of digital mind to some of the courses and actually go out there and develop something and bring something to life and you know, it doesn't take a great deal of, of technical expertise. Anything can be taught. And through that that course, um and yeah it's we're all creative, I think by nature. So I'd be happy for you to showcase Mendix platform to anybody who's got an app idea that they wish to develop and um, perhaps bring some value to the Siemens organization, so. Yeah, thanks for listening and hope it was. I hope it was a value.",4.0
"Hello I think this is a tech check so I'm just going to record for one minute to make sure that the tech and everything else is is working. Um. I'm going to do the benchmark video. Um, facilitating content with? Our global core team in services and goods. And an exercise in terms of solicitors so this soliciting feedback with regards to. Be engagement between. Global commodity management. Regional commodity management. Etc. And then trying to understand what works well. You know what? We. What would like, what we wish for? So what we wish for me more in terms of, you know, some aspiration behind that. Now if it were coming to an end.",
"So firstly, good morning, good afternoon, good evening to all depending on where you are in the world today. So welcome to the virtual services and goods Global Core Team Meeting Day 2. Um, I've got the pleasure to facilitate the first agenda item today, which is a group workshop session. Focus on our servers and goods global call team internal collaboration with particular emphasis on. How we work together in terms of global and regional engagement, it's an ongoing topic as you know and as it should be and it's been the focus of. Previous sessions in previous global core team meetings. And we could look at today as a form of. Pulse check. But it's also about, you know, forward-looking evolution, what we long to look to do to going forward. Um, indeed. You know what's changed or evolved in the past could well be inputs that you capture for the for the session today. And in terms of the timing, why do you hope, why do we hold it at this point in time well? The start of a new financial year always feels like the right time to. Reflect um. And also look forward into the new Year in terms of how we look to focus. So we've got about 75 minutes for the session. Today I'm going to use a concept ball to capture and review the inputs that we capture or we put forward as a group. Before we dive into the concept board, I just wanted to spend a minute or two. On the objectives of the session and how we plan the structure today, so. The objective of the session is to capture a commodity level. In terms of the global regional engagement with the context initially of the of the as is. So we're going to capture what we like, what's good. But also will capture. But what do we wish? So what would we like more of and also? What do we wonder? So it could be an open question. For example, you know why the global conventions with the whole Global Services group community stopped and we don't do them anymore. Then we're going to move on from that to consider for each of the three commodities how the market dynamics are changing, what that means for their strategies and then what that means for the global regional engagement and support into the future. So what would we like more of from global, for instance, or indeed what we might need less of, um, going into the future? So. You've been sent a link to the concept board in the teams chat, so if you now all I just want to go into into that quickly then I can show you around and then we can start the start this session. So I'm in. I'm sharing so you can see the concept, the concept board. I've gone to Section 1. So you can see that for each of the three commodities there, there's a one column for what we like, one column for what we wish, one column for what we wonder. Um. So I'd like us then to take 15 minutes as a group um to capture inputs on Post-its when you put a poster on. If you could put your name on there, please, and that would be great, and then will take 15 minutes to review together before moving onto. To Section 2. I'm just showing you quickly in Section 2. There's the same 3 columns and then it's about the changing market dynamics, what it means, and then capture what we might like more or less off. So hopefully that's OK for everybody. Um, let's start to capture the inputs 50 minutes and then we'll start to review as a group. Hopefully look forward to a good session. OK. Thank you.",5.0
"Hello, my name is Galina, and today I'm gonna be telling you a little bit about how I ended up in the shopper insights role at Heineken. I graduated college with a marketing degree and followed my career path based on what I thought I wanted to be when I grow up to an advertising agency in New York City. Shortly thereafter, after about two years, I recognize that that was not my passion point, and I really identified foods and food retail as my passion point. Um, anecdotally, after we immigrated to America, my family opened up Eastern European grocery stores, which I worked in all through school and college. And then during college, my older sister opened up her own boutique, also in foods, and I worked there as well. So it really felt. Near and dear to my heart, I went into retail in New York City and then I went into brokerage for about 6 years and identified that business development was fun, but Insights was more insightful and so I pursued a career in insights and analytics across now three different organizations. It really helps me put together two or three different areas that I am most passionate about. It gives me the opportunity to be analytical with data. It allows me to be insightful and understanding how consumers interact with products and make their decisions. And finally, it allows me to weave together stories to make our products more compelling to our distributors, retailers or organizations who are purchasing our products like individuals as well. Those pieces really helped me identify what I like to do.",6.0
"Making fish in my house is really difficult because my kids were very impacted by nemos. Fish are friends, not food statement and on top of the fact that they don't enjoy the taste and the texture, I found it difficult to find ways to feed them this healthy protein. I have tried over the course of 11 years to find exciting new, flavorful but approachable recipes to preparing salmon. So my expertise on this comes down to only one tried and true successfully curated meal with salmon, or any fish really. But my kids happen to only like what they call pink fish salmon. I take fresh mint, fresh fresh basil, fresh garlic and freshly squeezed lemon juice, not concentrate freshly squeezed lemon juice and the more the greens the better, and I puree that in a blender. With olive oil and salt. Outcomes a super fresh, super zesty, super flavorful marinade. I marinate the salmon for no more than 30 minutes to an hour in this gooey paste. So if you add more lemon juice, it's thicker. If you add a little more oil or more lemon juice, it's a more viscous consistency. I pour it over the top and then I bake it at 425 degrees. For about 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the thickness and the size portion of the fish. It is excessive oil endeavour every time because it's always unique depending on how much of the ingredients you add for each and they like it and I can feed them fish.",6.0

"I find that Heineken is a really fun place to work. The beauty of when I joined the organization as I had the opportunity to have the best of both worlds. As I was on boarding, I had the challenge of learning it during the at home work period. Now we have the opportunity to be back in the office two days a week. I really appreciate how much I missed the human interaction of being remote. The beauty of us coming back is the connectivity and the visibility and the. Collective energy that the CMI team has working altogether on site two days a week. One of the challenges I'm still facing as part of my on boarding, but also just an ongoing hardship I've encountered while at Heineken, is the challenges that the integrating with some of the other business units in the organization, especially the teams that I'm meant to partner with the most like category development.

"Hi there, my name is Hannah. Um. Today I'm going to talk to you about how I got to the role that I'm in at the minute, which is a Dos Equis brand director. Um, so I have worked as a brand manager, brand director for the last 10 years. My career started um in Kimberly-Clark professional where I took a one year internship um during my course at university to start to explore how I felt or was I interested in marketing. It's a great experience, but what I learned was that with being in business to business marketing, it wasn't as exciting as what I imagined, um, fast moving consumer goods marketing to be. So after my university course I applied to um go on the Heineken UK graduate scheme, which I was in Heineken UK for five years. I worked on the graduate scheme for about a year on the Heineken brand team. I then moved onto the desperado steam and in the last year of my time at Heineken UK I worked on red stripe and lag anitas looking to bring those brands from previous owners into our business for our commercial sales team. As part of that five years, I had great experience working on a number of global brands. However, I really needed to push my experience to learn more about, um, local brands and really driving creative development. So an opportunity came up where I was able to move to the US and work on the well renowned brand Dos Equis. And in the last five years that's where I've remained. And so when I initially moved here is very much focused on um, above the line, marketing, looking to um. Create all of our advertising from out of home to social media and television adverts and then more recently I've been working on our innovations, so that's just a quick overview of how I've got to my role as brand director at Heineken USA.",6.0

Um, there's a number. There's a poor piece of pork you need to purchase and a number of, um, flavored spices to add in once you've purchased all your ingredients. You can go home, cut the pork into one inch slices, and then mix all of the ingredients into one bowl together. You can then put the pork into the marinade and if you have 24 hours pop that in the fridge. If not, you can leave it for just two hours um to marinade. Then you can Preheat your oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Once is preheated, you can put the pork in to cook. And leave it in there for about 3 hours, with every hour turning it to make sure each of the edges are browned. Once the three hours is up, you should have a super crispy piece of shredded pork. Um, ready to go. You can then get your tortillas ready, slice each of the different pieces of pork and pop them in to make the perfect taste. Emm Taco. Enjoy. You could also add some garnishes such as cilantro or pineapple or onions with a little bit of green salsa as well to make it the perfect Mexican meal.",4.0

Outline of the agenda is pretty simple, so we start with the first. Thank you, I just did. Um, I wish you all the very nice welcome. Nice to have you here, and I will tell you something about the purpose of this workshop. But to start with, um, please enter your name in this welcome section here so that we know who's there. Um, maybe also give a short info together with your name, where you're located, and what you're working on. I will give you 1 1/2 minutes for that so that you can write your name. Tell us where you live and. Two or three bullet points about your current tasks. So thank you for having entered your name. Time is up. And, um, I would like to know. I would like now to come to the purpose of the stigma and workshop. And for this there's a quotation from Abraham Maslow, which I would like to show you, so that you see about what is the purpose of this ticket, mind workshop, it's in any given moment we have two options, to step forward into growth or to step back into safety. And the intention of today's workshop is to provide you tools and measures and methods to step forward into growth, not to lean back and stay in safety, but really to be growing. Our ambition, asks EMM, is we are growing. We are growing from a dinosaur, a cost cutter, into a value at orchestrator. You can see here on the on the top right and the value AH orchestrator star in this star consists out of several ingredients, which is the availability we're taking care of the quality, productivity, innovation, sustainability. All important topics, buzzwords until now and we will fill them with life and with purpose and together with these. Um, buzzwords with these activities? Also here, of course, comes interaction with suppliers, with customers, with people in general and also with processes. And this is what we'll focus on in the next 1 1/2 days. In the. Indigo, mind workshop. Digital minds. As a starting point consists out of two words. The first one is digital, obviously, in the second one is mind. But what does it mean when we connect them? It means the digital part means that it refers to a digital age we're living in, not bound to digitalization technology, but it also includes collaboration, innovation and change. And mind, of course. Refers to what we have in our heads, how we behave, how we act. So its openness, capability to carry change, collaboration, innovation and of course also then linked to the topic digitization and technology.",4.0
"So I would start laying out my plan for my team. Um. I just starting with expectations on how we're all going to be working together over the course of the project that we would be working on. And that would include things like how often were meeting and communicating, whether it's on a daily basis every few days or whatever the project requires. I would lay out what deadlines were working towards, you know, ultimately what what the ultimate deadline is for the project, as well as key progress checkpoints we would want to have along the way. And then I would I would lay out what the key deliverables are that we need to create and then get into details on the work product itself and what we need to get done over the course of this project. So after laying all of that out and kind of setting the ground rules, I would I would then move on to delegating the roles and the work streams across the various team members. You know, at the beginning of the project I would talk to each team member and get a preliminary indication of their weaknesses, their strengths, their experiences, their skill set as well as their development goals and just get a better understanding of how to best allocate. The work across the team in order to balance using people's skills and where they're strong, as well as where they want to get new experience and build new skills and fill any gaps and get new experiences that they might require. Then I would move on to just getting into the details of the deliverable and the work product. You know, I would focus on what content would need to create, what information needs to be learned and included in whatever deliverables were creating, what the expectations are for what we want to get done and then just reiterate what the timeline is for this project and. Just how much we want to get get done and you know, bye bye, what dates, you know, would try to set checkpoints kind of throughout the project to make sure that we're moving at a good pace and then just make it clear, you know, what the expected expected deadlines are. Well, once I've played all that out I would just ask her any questions from the team and see if anyone has any feedback or issues with the game plan and go from there.",5.0
"Think my management philosophy is based on really early two key things. One is leading by example and then two is just focusing on communication across the team.

You know, when I'm in that seat as a manager, I never want to ask members of my team to do things that I wouldn't do or that I really wouldn't want to do myself. So just showing them that. You know, I'm there for them. Um, you know, I'm kind of doing the things that I'm preaching I think is important. And then, yeah, focusing on communication, making sure that lines of communication are always open across the team and giving feedback and seeing where people need help.",4.0
"The team is doing very well so far. Um, we focused on allocating roles. Based on balancing both people strengths and skills, but also their development goals and where they wanted to try something new that would stretch them and push them and give them the chance to grow in a new way or into a new skill set. And so. I think it's going as planned so far. You know, people are stretching but not so much that they can't handle it and or were communicating throughout the project. We're continuing the talk to each other across the team about where people may need more help or more guidance, what's going well, what's going out well and um. You know, people seem to be happy in their roles because. It's pushing them. It's forcing them to grow in new ways, but they're also able to use the skills that they've built up already and the experiences that they've had in the past to apply to these new rules and to grow into it. And so the work is getting done and the team is continuing to meet their own development goals as well. So happy with the progress so far and things are things going well.",
"My boss is a managing director at the company. Then their their rule consists of a couple of things. I think first and foremost it's developing the team, developing of the managers and associates under them and making sure they're growing and allocated to projects that will help them grow and gain the experience that they need. So it's really people. Management is a big part of it. The second piece is making sure that projects go well. You know, providing oversight, providing guidance on how to do certain things and get information that teams need, and just making sure that the project goes well without being too in the weeds or micromanaging. And then lastly, it's. Selling is a big component of that job to, you know, selling new work, getting new clients, making sure clients are happy and continuing to develop new business for the future.",
"Thanks for taking the time to meet with me. Um. Wanted to check in and you know talk about what's been going well or not well in the past two months that we've been working together and. I like particularly just wanted to focus on areas of improvement. Um, you know, just just from what I've seen and working with you over the last two months, you've been underperforming in a couple of areas that. I think will be important for you to improve in and that I think you can improve in, but just wanted to lay it out and work work with you on these key areas. And so couple of things. Your deliverables are often late, you know we set clear deadlines. We tried to make it clear that you know what progress we're trying to make and by Flynn, and you're often missing those deadlines. Your attitude has also been negative and it's important to be mindful of how your attitude and how you carry yourself affects the rest of the team that you're working with and how it might affect how others are feeling and their morale. And so that's an important issue too. And then lastly, just overall you're impacting the team's goals for the quarter, you know, because. Because of your underperformance in some areas, um, it's making it tough for the team to get done what it needs to get done. And so it's really important that. We we take a look together at you know how you can go about improving. I'm going to work closely with you to help you continue to learn and grow in these areas and hopefully improve and we can get to a better place.",5.0
"So we have a 100 piece polar bear and tiger puzzle. As you guys know, there's ten other teams that were competing against and we're trying to be the fastest. So the way we do that, I think is by starting by putting together the outer edges of the puzzle, you know the border because it'll be easier to see which pieces have a flat side and so they should all go on the border. And also I think we can focus on putting together key landmarks within the puzzle. And what that means is parts of the image that we can easily identify that might be the polar bears head, the tigers head, the paws, the tails. And so I think that will help us get large portions of the puzzle put together more quickly that we can, that we can put together and have the boundary set up as well.

What is my short path within the company and what is my current occupation? I set up with Siemens in 2010. Back then there was a special training program for procurement in place. So I applied for that successfully and I started as a commodity manager for Tamil plastic parts and residents. In Rings broke back then there was a location for low voltage business unit and I was responsible for that. A commodity for the whole and low voltage business unit. After the merge with the medium Voltage business unit, I was warned a year responsible for the whole division back then LMV. And within that job, I successfully applied for procurement manager position in Berlin. So I took over this position in 2014. And did that for four years was very exciting time, was my first leader position, leading people working together with people working in a factory, so was very, very exciting. And after I did that, my former boss Martin Furci asked me because he changed his position. If I want to take over the operations switching, switching devices as a procurement manager, so it sounded exciting for me, so I did that. So, and since right now 2018, I'm responsible for the operations switching devices within the newly formed business unit E EH, that includes currently four locations globally. So I'm based in the lead factory in Berlin and also it is my responsibility the location in Shanghai. China, Berlin as mentioned in Heber Springs the US and Kelly to Mexico. So basically I'm heading the procurement department for these for these four locations. They are right now changes also now organization. So there will be in new location coming coming in. In the upcoming fiscal year, so Wendell also will be a. Location for my operation. So I also take take over that dedication and basically the goal is to set up the strategy for these four locations working with the people on site. And you know that we are let's say within our EA strategy to coach the people to setting up the supplier strategy for the communities together working with the commodity managers in Berlin. So I really enjoy that has. Because you are in contact with a lot of different people, not only different different cultures, but also different to different stakeholders, different functions. So specially in that in the last, I think upcoming 1 1/2 years, it was, you know, really key to work with people, um to let's say, yeah, getting along with all these challenges we have currently in our supply chain. So I really, really enjoyed that job. Um. And yeah, that's about, that's about me. I'm not married. I have a girlfriend right now living in the solvent eastern part of Berlin. Um, I'm joined it, so I'm looking forward to that training. And wish everybody would weekend. Thank you very much.",4.0

If you get the call that during the the training, so please make out your phones and let's continue here. So agenda for today, so first we have a little introduction session so that you know each other a bit better. We will have a short welcome and then we give you an introduction in the outer world. So what happened to last years, what is very important here, how can we continue on these topics? Then specifically for you the future of procurement, So what is going to change, what will be the impact, what will change in your daily job? Um. Next topic after lunch break is the digital mind shape the future. So this sounds fantastic and basically it is, so you will learn about it and what happens there. Then topic is mind the gap. And then the topic. Let's play. So it's all about gamification and try out things. Um, someone said it's easy to remember things if you try it out yourself, so therefore you should try it out yourself. To learn more about this topic. Um, thought today's workshop we also have parking lots or none of your questions will be lost. Sometimes it's not possible to answer them. So therefore we will like to ask you to put it on the parking lot, either by telling me or writing it out the concept board yourself so that these questions could be answered right away, or at the end of the workshop, or even afterwards there. Um, first thing that we do is start little introduction with the MS Teams. Um, so first question, anybody get no clue how to use MS Teams? OK, so it should be easy, but nevertheless let's let's check everything that we need for today's workshop and you can follow the links here. We are going to the brain room, the maker room or the mover room. The topic depends where you want to go there. So by now, do you have any questions or it's all clear? OK, yeah, I can see you raise your hand. OK, it was not a purpose, OK? So please feel free to ask any time. I think it's most important that everybody is aware of what we're doing, so feel free to ask media. OK then I would say we start with a little introduction around. So please feel free. Um I would like to do a bit differently not going following the row but maybe we can do a little game that we going by the first name and I'll decide to stay on this side. Just sat and please bring yourself in the order that everybody is aware what you're where you are basically. OK. Thank you very much.",3.0
Hello.,
"Hello. So today we're doing the Digital Minds workshop. Um, so hopefully you've all had a chance to do the tech check. Um, this will go. This would have given you an opportunity to write your truth and a lie. Um, so we can kind of go through that gets know each other as a bit of an icebreaker, learn a bit more about each other, and hopefully find out a few things. So if you haven't had a chance to write your truth and a lie, um will just give you a few minutes to do that. Get that. And so that we're all able to kind of, um, start together and then the process will be, um, I'll pick someone. And then once they've read out a truth and alive from somebody else on the board, they will then decide the truth, which is the truth and which is the lie. Um. And then we will then find out from that person who they um. Who they guess, whether they guess correctly or not. And then that person will then choose somebody else. And then that way we'll keep going until we've been through, um, everybody in the let's meet board. Um, hopefully that'll give every opportunity to kind of meet each other and get to know a bit more about each other. Um, as we will obviously be working together. For the next day and 1/2 or so. Um. I mean, some of these are pretty, pretty interesting, so that will be a good opportunity to learn a little bit more about each other. Um, once we've done a truth and a lie will then go through the workshop with gender. Um. So kind of we will. Um. I'll give you a bit of a plan for today, kind of giving timings, expected timing. So if you need and if you need to pop out at any moment, just let us know, just kind of put it in the chat or um just say on say over teams. That's fine. I'm just a few housekeeping things. So if we could keep cameras on and microphones on, obviously, um, we're here to the more interactive this workshop is the better and the more you'll get out of it. So as we will, we will just. Do the um, truth and a lie now. OK, so once we've finished that, we will kind of find the. We will go through the purpose of this. Um. Workshop. So, um, we'll go through the outer world chapter and we'll kind of um develop and it this will will come a little bit more clear or third chapter is future procurement. Um. This gives us an opportunity to go out into the breakout rooms, which hopefully you've worked out how to do during the tech check. But as I say, we're all here to help. So if you need anything extra or you get stuck in the ether, give us, give us a shout and we can see what we can do, will then go through the trend cards and obviously will be split up. Buyer are um. Viral breakout rooms. So that'll give us an opportunity to kind of build those trend cards. Um. And then we'll look back to see what we've done and we can have some feedbacks that'll be brilliant. Then we will move on to the digital mind shaping the future section. This is more of, again a little bit more group work, but everyone has their own sort of, um input to this. So obviously the more contributed more you'll get out of this and then we will continue on through the workshop. Um, yeah, as I say, if you need a break or anything, um, there are scheduled breaks. So hopefully you can kind of hang on until that those moments. Um will then go through the mind. The gap um, and we'll kind of progress on through this workshop was to be gay. Ah. Does anyone have any questions in the mean time? Um, and if we've all finished doing our truth and a lie, let's get going. So does. So I can start um. And the truth and the light is.",3.0

I ended up as a marketing major, came out of college, had a hard time finding a role in marketing and advertising that I was looking for. So I ended up working with a recruiting company who got me a temporary job at SCI. Who works in a similar capacity as purging managed account solutions at the time. After my temp role at SEI was complete, they set me up with Persian um. I worked my way through a number of different roles with Pershing including I started an account maintenance in the managed accounts area, got my Series 7 and 66 licenses, and then moved over to the trading area from their work my way up. Through different supervisor and manager roles went and got another license. So I have a series 24 as well so I can now sign off as a principle. Um. After purging, X was announced, right?

"Alright, my favorite food. This is going to be a tough one. Thought about it for a minute. I think I have to go to separate ways doing a little surf and turf, right? Um will start with a filet, right? What I like to do with a filet mignon. I will get out a cast iron pan, throw in some butter and some time turn it up. Ah, real hot on the stove, right? You want to sear that for about a minute, minute and 1/2 on each side. Before you put it into the oven to finish, right? Obviously when you get that full layout, you want to let it rest for a little bit before you cut into it. Let the juices absorb back in there. On the other side of that, it's not a standard surf and turf, but my favorite piece of fish is a Chilean sea bass. Um, very similar preparation right to the fill, eh? I like to do it in a cast iron pan. I like to do it with a good bit of butter with the. Fish I do like to add some acidity right? So will throw in some lemon juice on there as well, but I will finish that in the cast iron pan. On the stove, making sure that you sort of raise it right in the butter, you have to keep putting it on top, making sure that gets absorbed through the piece of fish and that's really going to give it that nice buttery finish. Put those two together and get any kind of size that you think fit right, mashed potatoes, some roasted potatoes, some asparagus, anything like that. That's going to be my go to. Simple to get together, but also very big. Crowd pleaser. So that's my favorite meal to cook.",4.0

"I know this is rather cliche for someone from southeastern Pennsylvania, but my favorite vacation destination is the New Jersey shore. It has everything you know. I need it with my growing family, right? Two small children. We have the rides up on the boardwalk. It's a lovely beach to go ride waves right in Ocean City, which is where my family specifically goes. It is a dry town, so you don't have all the college kids coming around like you would in a CIL or seaside heights. Right. With the party time center out of town thing. So it's a little lazier, right? You can go. You're still in plenty of distance to get to Atlantic City if you want to go gambling or go to a show or casinos, right?

It also is very easy to have calls, record videos like this, right as there's no outside noise. I would say the worst part of my current workplace is that I don't have the ability to collaborate in an office setting like I used to in the King of Prussia office, which has been sold.

"Hi, good morning. My name is Eric Marquis. Work at purging, part of the client Transitions department. I've been with purging almost 25 years. Interesting story. Family friend was working at purging at the time, and he owned a painting company. So I was working with him over the summer after I graduated college, trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. So he suggested, hey, I can get your resume to get a resume together and I could submit that. To one of the contacts that have it, purging seems like a great company. People are happy, they're nice and maybe a good career opportunity for you. So I said, you know what? Why not? You know? So I put my resume together, got a haircut, bought a new suit because at that time didn't have a suit. And I went on the interview. Things went really well at the time. This was in the late 90s, so a lot of hiring going on on Wall Street. Um, real exciting opportunity and. And and there it was. So I gotta gotta offered a position. I started within about three weeks he made me finish some painting commitments we already had. So I followed through on that and I started, uh, Pershing working the domestic clearance area, made some great contacts. Um, I still work with today in 25 years later, I'm still here working in the client Transitions group, as I mentioned. Um, and it was a. Long and windy Rd, but pretty interesting start.

"Hi, good morning. My name is Eric Marquis, here today to teach you about how to cook. My grandmother sauce come from an Italian family, so actually we refer to it as gravy. It's a big debate within the food community whether it's gravy or sauce, but I'll use them interchangeably. Grew up with gravy, but it really is sauce, so. Um, as I mentioned, my grandmother says my grandmother's recipe, she lived with us when I was a kid, so I got to enjoy it quite a bit and I enjoy eating. So she passed it on to me, um, to ensure I could always be well fed, so we'll jump right into it. So it's pretty basic. A lot of people think, you know, making sauce could be hard and complicated, but this recipe, really, it comes down to some basic ingredients, but just the way it's prepared, I think what distinguishes it from most other recipes? So always need garlic. Ingredient #1 is garlic and a good olive oil. So what we normally start with is sauteing the garlic on a low heat. I like to chop it up and mince it, put it in the oil and then turn on the heat and kind of let it come to temperature and you'll see it start to bubble around the garlic around the sides of it until the aroma starts to permeate in the air. I like to use a lot of garlic. I could, you could use it really could do whatever you want. But I like to use almost close to a whole clove. I'm sorry, a whole head. So 8 to 10 cloves of garlic would be the right number. And then when I do that, I pour in two cans of crushed tomatoes and you can crush them with your hands or with the spoon and smash it down into the garlic and stir it. Then key piece here is fresh basil. All you need to do is tear a few leaves into the into the sauce, stir it in, simmer. And let it cook for an hour. You could taste it along the way. Season it with some salt and pepper as you like and there you go. It will keep in the freezer the fridge for a long time and it's delicious. Thank you.",5.0

Um, then ultimately, um. You know, began working in an operational role which I advanced in from basically an entry level trade processing clerk to the role I am in now as a director and trading services. So for me it was a 20 year journey, um from really entry level 2. Mid level management roles to uh, essentially a senior management role within trading. So again, it really was a journey right from. Ah, being young and somewhat night night naive to the overall. Scope of where my career path would take me. But at the same time, you know, continue to work hard, stay focused and you know, look for opportunities for advancement.

What I'll do is I will pound them very thin with a mallet so that they tend to rise. At which point I will look to flower the cutlets. And then egg and bread them while the UM colleagues are essentially drying on a drying rack. I will then look to prepare my sauce right. I use a high quality. San San Marzano style um tomato, which I will crush by hate by hand. I mean normally I'm using a whole peeled. Um, and I will fry some garlic up in a pan with a little bit of olive oil, throw in my tomatoes and make a basic marinara sauce with sea salt, black pepper and fresh basil. While my sauce is cooking I will then begin to pan fry the chicken cutlets, um about 2 minutes per side, just slightly golden brown and as they are finished cooking remove them from the pan and put them onto a drying rack. By that point, I normally will give the sauce about 30 minutes to cook. And I will then begin to prepare the chicken Parmesan.

"Hi, my name is John Wolf on the product managers here at albridge, otherwise known as Persia, next part of the BNY Mellon universe. Over the last two years, we spend time developing a tool called report designer. During that occurrence, we were able to spend a large amount that time daily with a large group, about 20 people every day who are developers, designers, other project managers, business analysts and sales people to develop the product from initial concept all the way straight through the development time. Sorry to implementation. During that process we spent a lot of time collaborating with ourselves, but externally it is a key part of this type of functionality for us to understand the user research and to be able to understand what are people actually looking for and happily get out address those needs. In doing so, we worked a lot ah's peer set to split up and speak with our external counterparts. So will there be someone in a firm's Home Office that we were collaborating with and what's their vision, design for, what they need to do with the functionality and tool itself or speaking with our own internal sales group? Collaboration was a key part of this actual process and something will probably replicate and most of the projects we do moving forward. This is the first venture to such a large effort to collaborate, both internally and externally, but that's not going to slow down anytime soon. When you start to think about how it works functionally, posts its success was really based upon it. So when you start to actually look into the use cases of it today, you get to see someone's actions take place. Some things that they promised or said they would do. Sometimes they didn't do what they thought they would do, but that type of feedback helps alot 'cause then we start to collaborate a little more in the future. We start to really start to think about. Did this make sense? This is what this person is actually saying is actually the use case.

"Hi there. I wanted to go into a little bit of how one of my most favorite products developed actually works. The report designer, the report designers of functionality that allows you, the user to design your own wealth reports. Today we most wealth reports are out-of-the-box or stable. You hit run reports done, whether it's from the adviser perspective or the investor perspective, it's the same thing. You get a bank statement. It was like every other state make sure received the difference of how this product works, however. It's completely customized for the user. So especially if you're someone in the financial services industry trying to work with a specific client, maybe they have a specific need this specific type of product that requires a very unique reporting type methodology or system. This is a nice way to be able to build it to show the message you want to show that is important to you in your end investor. Without necessarily having to rely upon what's there and it's very important for the discussion 'cause that make sure that you don't have any point struggle to have to put something on and compromise and talk wrestling that isn't really necessarily aligned with your focus or for the client. So we utilize it. It's actually more drag and drop. You take elements such as a table or chart from selection pane, drag it into a grid form and be able to actually build out what you want to look like both in content of the actual elements of the compose themselves. Or the components and how they align. Maybe you want to stretch a table full page. Maybe you want a line graph like being the upper corner. So to you how you do it.

But when you're there, it's a fully log down type of town. It's very unique. It's stuck in the late 1800s essentially, sorry, even the early 1800, sorry in the colonial spirit. So you're going to have some. Elements revolution, the 1700s against some elements of the early 1800 life. You get the livid, it's the sights, the smells, the feeling of being in that time period. So it really is in a very engrossed experience and it helps younger children learn a lot more affectively regarding next type of that time period because you're starting to live it.

In the past 12 months, we had a client that was looking to attract order flow from UM money manager, a prominent money manager. Um, that money manager, however. Did require that um broker dealer our client, the broker dealer had certain equity algorithms that they could work order flow through on their behalf. In other words, that broker dealer needed to access certain types of algorithmic strategies in order to facilitate the order flow from this money manager. So um. We had several calls with the broker dealer member of my team who um does work on our suite of algorithms and works on the auto routing logic. Um, those algorithms. He led the conversations with this broker dealer client, um. There were three strategies that they were looking to. Customize in order to attract this order flow from the money manager. One was a specialized smart order router that um executed in certain liquidity pools that they designated um. The other two were customized um algorithms. One was called the volume weighted average price and the other one was called a dark pool seeking strategy called Explorer. And we successfully customized all three of those strategies and the broker deal won the business from the money manager.",2.0
"Hi I'd like to talk about my favorite food to prepare. It would be BBQ ribs. The way they're prepared are, um, you get some good quality baby back ribs.

And you advance or down where your ball landed and hit the ball where it lies. It's a game about honor. And it's also a game about. Self love versus self hate.

I interviewed several times there and finally got a position in the international.

"Hi, my name is Shane, and one of my favorite things to do, which is very therapeutic, is painting. Um, painting rooms? It's something that's very soothing to me, so I'm going to teach you how to do it yourself. Um, whether you're painting a powder room or the exterior of your house, the general rule of thumb is you probably need to know how much paint you'll need. And that's about four one gallon covers approximately, um, you know, 400 square feet. Um, also, you need to choose your color. That's very important. Um. You know, do you want cool colors, warm colors, neutral, saturated? And you also have to take into account furniture and how that would compliment, you know your furniture as well. You need to also have the tools, your materials, right? Um, and 'cause. Every job is unique, whether it's painting, like I said, the exterior or interior room. You're going to, you know, of course, need the paint. Paint rollers, drop cloth, paint brushes. Your paint trays, sandpaper, painters tape, putty knife, sand rags, things like that. So very important. Always be prepared before you start any painting project. Um, prepping the walls. Extremely, extremely important. Um, what? You know, make sure the room is empty or if you don't have space, you could kind of get the move all your furniture to the middle and then put drop clots or light plastic over it to make sure you're protecting from. Any spills? You know you want to do the same thing. If you're painting the kitchen like cabinetry, countertops anywhere that could you could be in danger of Excel access spilling or splattering and then you want to grab your painters tape and apply to all the edges of the room. Another point I want to make is mixing your paint, very important. Make sure you get that wooden spoon mixture paint, make sure it's mixed well, otherwise the consistency. Of the paint may compromise the color OK and look at the technique. You know whether you want you want to start from the top of the room, from the ceiling and work your way down.

Lighting, lighting extremely important, making sure you could focus, but you don't want too much lighting where you can't see, um, air quality. You want to make sure that the rain is not. Really hot or cold, but a nice temperature where people could work. Um, and you know, maybe decorations accessing the accent walls are things like that could make a an office feel. Vibrant collaboration rooms, you know, places where people could gather and and maybe talk and brainstorm, think about ideas.

There will be 2 service teams, the Wealth Solutions team and ODA service teams. But first, I want to dive into the Well Solutions team first and this team will provide support to our broker dealers and registered investment advisors. These clients will have a dedicated service team. Clients will no longer have to dial into the one 800 number and listen to prompts and figure out which team they need to speak to anymore. These clients will also have a direct dial into their dedicated service team. This team will also take ownership of the call regardless of their expertise. It's really a one stop shopping white glove service, better experience for our clients. Now let's get into the oldest service team. This team will provide support into our institutional clients as well as our Wealth Solutions team. In regards to institutional clients, really no change to the institutional model. Those clients can still call into the operations team as they do today and if they had wished, they can also call into the uh, the service team for assistance.

"So how did I end up in this role? Right? Um. Having worked at EG Plus for awhile, I. Prior to COVID. Going by today, today going to the office and then when COVID hit, I was working on a project that was they were. Trying to launch a new car company in the US, really exciting, big challenge. How do they market it, whether they want to change how they want to. Name the cars and the market segments, market segments and it's just interesting things like that. So was working on that and then as Kovid started to hit. Um realized? Perhaps a lot of people aren't going to be going out to buy new cars. And probably not from a Chinese car company, so. That. Maybe reconsider that longevity of that project and they came with this new project that we set up this new client. It's going to be with Sony, and I was kind of curious about it. It's a big change, slightly different. From my background, but they said it's Sony PlayStation and it's the global localization for Sony PlayStation. And. I thought about it and I thought. Game sitting at home, people on the couch, I think think that might actually have more legs than a brand new car company from China. So transition to that. And I was excited about the fact that that particular program was brand new. So there was no. Expectation of the job role or other people so we could build a team from scratch. Um, I thought that was a very. Interesting challenge and um gave a lot of flexibility in order to figure out how we build. The team that we wanted to see, so I jumped at the chance.",6.0

For me, at least, it was at the beginning of Kovid, right? Really, right before COVID hit everything about COVID. On for the. App Tik T.O.K which is not new, everybody super familiar with it but given two years ago when it first hit it was. Hit these little fringes of people that really fell in love with it and everyone else had no idea what you're talking about. Everyone was like Instagram and Facebook and uh, but super younger crowd on it. Um. In what I loved about it was that. I think it's really brilliant about specially mobile apps, as many of those don't tell you how to use it. You just have to discover it so you can use it in a very simplistic way and not feel like you're don't understand. It's not like Photoshop or there's all these widgets and you don't know what to press and you're like, I don't know these things and I'm an idiot, um, super simple. You could just watch videos and then you got interested, you could add videos. And in the early stages people were really experimenting with filters and doing interesting things. Um, Cutups and and really connecting to, like, these fringe groups of people where you could find, um, Northwestern? Liberal vegan gun owners like that would be a group they could participate in, so I thought it was fascinating and really easy to. Like certain things and build up an algorithm to see more content.

"Hello everyone, it's James I wanted to give you a quick update how I've gotten to my role as the Vice President of service level incident monitoring. Everyone probably wondering what does that mean?

And the second role that falls under that is the issue tracker, which sends out an e-mail to 800 participants. To notify them of any critical operational issues which may be occurring in which also notifies our communication team to send out a communication to our clients notifying them of the issue. So how did I get in this role? I am quite the journeyman. I have a project management background, Series 7 Series 24. And then I also used to work for Lockheed Martin doing their finance for building the Hellfire missile. So everyone says, well, how do those two correlate? Well, it's all about project management and about relationships and communicating. I took one more sidestep there. I went to Fiserve after Lockheed Martin for a few years to strengthen my business analyst skills and really learn about Fintechs.

Um, as many of you have heard on the news or from different updates, 2 million people are joining the pickleball alliance every every month. So it's really growing so real quick. How to play pickleball obviously eating a pickle ball court, which is a small net, I don't know, probably 15 feet wide. And you need a pickleball court, which you could paint onto a tennis court. Um, I would say it's probably about half the size. Of a tennis court. And then you need at least two pickleball paddles in a pickle ball, which is similar to a Wiffle ball. And so. Um, yeah, one person on each side, and basically it's just like ping pong on a tennis court. So you play a 21 you have to serve to score. And we'll kind of go through this serving protocol. You serve from the right side to the left side for the first serve. And the the server. Actually has to bounce the ball below their waist and swing under their waste to get to serve Haskell across and land in the small yellow box. Not the kitchen, not the smallest kitchen box, but the big yellow box. And then. If you hit it and the other person doesn't return it after one bounce, then it's a point for your team.

Ah, one of the best. Advice I've ever gotten for making a pizza is actually once your dough is ready to go, you use pancake mix as your flower for the pan. So make sure to put the pancake mix down on on the cookie sheet that you're using. So a bunch of flower on the cookie sheet and that, sorry, a bunch of pancake mix on the cookie sheet. Pancake mix all over the dough that you have, roll it out ready to go. Um, and then once you have that rolled out, put all of your ingredients on top. Sauce, cheese, pepperoni's, you know, whatever you like on your pizza. Little bit of, um, spices. So salt, pepper or whatever you like on your pizza. Um, cook that for about 10 minutes on 425 in the oven. Um, the next thing you need to do to make sure that it comes out really, really crispy is too. Then pop it from the cookie rack. After 10 minutes, pop from the cookie rack or, sorry, the cookie sheet onto the rack. So the oven rack. You want it on there by itself? Um, put a pan underneath to catch any of the drippings if you put too much sauce or something like that. But that will give you the best crispy pizza.

"Hi everyone. I am going to give you a little bit of a background on how I ended up in the role I'm currently in. So prior to coming to Heineken USA five years ago, I worked for a pharmaceutical company and I was there in a variety of roles for basically my entire career. A good friend of mine joined Hein again and reached out and said she thought would be a great fit for me. And so I took a leap of faith and joined the procurement department at Heineken USA and I really enjoyed what I was doing there. I was working with. The BTL team on our point of sale and merchandising, and it was an area I wasn't familiar with in the past, but really liked the aspect of it and showing how we actually showed up as a brand in stores. And I didn't know a whole lot about that area when I first started out, but I knew a lot about procurement. So my business partners were excellent and really helped catch me up to speed with what I need to know about that part of the industry. I also decided that I really wanted to be more on the business end rather than the supporting business partnering and in this area. And Fortune smiled on me and a new group was being developed called the PMO in marketing, which was the program management office. And that department that did not exist yet was going to need a director to help create the group, the methodology, the policies, the procedures, everything that went along with it. And I talked to my business partner who would become a friend and she helped me prepare for this role and I was hired for it and now I am three years in to the PMO. We have established a really great repertoire with the business and have helped to really streamline our ATL to BTL to commercialization policies. And that is how I ended up where I currently AM today. Thank you.",6.0
"So I'm going to let you in on a little secret. And this has to do with one of those dishes that you see somebody bring to a party or they have at their house and you think it took them a ton of time to put together and make. And it really didn't, and that is my baked Brie. So if you ever come over for a glass of wine or a dinner party or anything to my house, one of the things you'll usually see as an appetizer is baked Brie dish, and people always think it took. Quite a bit of effort and it takes roughly 3 to 5 minutes, but don't tell. So all you have to do is Preheat the oven to 375, take out a cast iron pan, get Pillsbury Crescent rolls and put them in the pan. Also spray the pan first with a little bit of canola oil. Once you do that, you take a round of Brie, stick that in the present rolls take some jam. I like the four different flavors. Mixed together. Put that on top. Take the other half of the president role and layer it. You could get fancy and do like a basket weave or something, or just pop it right on there. Then you take some Maple syrup drizzled on top and justice. Sprinkle brown sugar, pop it in the oven for 20 minutes, and then serve it with your favorite crackers. I like the Rosemary Chris from Trader Joe's. Also adds a little touch of additional flavor there, and then you can serve it right in the skillet. With the crackers, it is so delicious. You make it hot, you serve it hot, and people really go crazy for it. If this is something you want to bring to someone's house, you can also throw it in one of your nicer baking dishes and pop it in the oven when you get there. Or just pull it out right before you are ready to leave. And again, people will think that you spent a lot of time on something that took you less than 20 minutes.",5.0

So when we started this department about three years ago, there were no policies or procedures or Darcy's in place and that was the first act of business and my role was making sure that we understood what needed to be done when and how that had to be executed.

"Favorite vacation destination? OK, usually I would say the beach because anywhere with ocean and water and sand equals a wonderful time. But the best place I've ever been was in Rome, and the main reason that you should definitely take a visit there is because you were so surrounded by culture and history and this sense of the past while also being able to go grab a Starbucks right around the corner from the Colosseum. Or the Spanish steps and just the history and food and people and culture will forever give you a sense of just how much has happened in this world that we haven't seen or aren't aware of. And you don't really get that here in the US. So definitely a plane trip to Rome to see all that history would be a high recommendation mine.",

It's not as easy to just walk over to someone's desk and ask them. Uh. Question. There's a lot more technology and planning involved in those types of conversations, so learning how to best navigate what this new world looks like and how to really communicate and make sure what's discussed sticks as far as decisions would be an area that I think we can improve on here at Hein again.

So we can each do our part to create less waste by using. Reusable water bottles instead of the plastic kind and making sure that if we are using plastic or any types for cycle elements that we go ahead and dispose of them properly so that they can get new life and don't end up in the landfill's.

"My plan for my team is to create a place where people can flourish and grow into somebody who can. Take themselves far in this job as well as beyond. That 4 letters that I would like to talk about.

Together with me, we also I also work with people from outside the organization, freelances, video, video producers, people who. Have specific talents that cannot be found.

For us not to share the same context for certain conversations and much of the work is done virtually. Therefore, it is very important for all of us to understand each other and be on the same page. Even though it's takes more effort. I have found that to do this requires constant communication, whether it's by e-mail or if we just ping each other on teams um or on WhatsApp. And a big part of my job is just to make sure that everyone has the information that they need in order to do their job well. And because I'm the central. Point of contact for everybody. I. Should be.

"Hi, my name is John Weigel and I'm going to teach you today how to make my favorite chocolate chip coffee cake recipe. First, you'll need a yellow cake mix. Any yellow cake mix you can get at the grocery store spine. Then what you need to do is combine the yellow cake mix with one package of instant. Vanilla jello. I know it sounds strange, but it adds moisture to the cake. You'll then add four gently um mixed eggs to the mixture, 8 ounces of sour cream um, 1/2 cup water, and 1/2 cup oil. You'll mix this together and get a nice smooth consistency. While you're doing that, you will spray a bundt pan with olive oil spray and prepare it to have the mixture poured into it. And then one year already, and the last step before pouring the wet mixture into the bunt pan is to add chocolate chips. The recipe calls for 1/4 cup of chocolate chips, but I say measure with your heart. You'll then pour the mixture into the bunt pan and you'll take 1/3 cup brown sugar and a half a cup of white sugar and a tablespoon of cinnamon and mix that together. You'll then drizzle that over the top of the cake and put that into the oven. You bake the cake at 350 degrees for 55 minutes to one hour. I hope that you enjoy the cake. It's always a very favorite at family get togethers and it's it's great to enjoy for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Have a good day.",5.0

The main role of the team is overseeing the execution process of our mutual fund orders for both NSCC. Funds as well as funds supported on euro clearest fund settle platform. There are three specific functions that the team handles each day. Which includes reviewing and processing service center submitted by ER, introducing firms, reviewing trade rejects with the fund companies, and handling calls via our 800 client service line. The Mutual Fund Order desk phone line is supported by the client service team. The calls are first fielded by this team and if they need assistance then they. Then the client service associate will either conference in and associates from the order desk or there will transfer the call to our dedicated phone Q if you have our large. Mutual fund clients have a direct connection to our team, so when they dial into the 800 line, they bypass the client service team and are immediately in our queue. Service center requests are submitted by err introducing firms and most of them are related to trade corrections. While some may consist of current day orders, any request submitted prior 3:30 must be completed by market close. Various types of Corrections are submitted so the associates need to review each recruit each request accordingly to determine the best course of action to take on behalf of our clients. The associates handling NSCC rejects will work with the funds and then transfer agents on T1. They need to ensure that they review each reject accordingly with the transfer agents and ensure that they contact them prior to the price protection cutoff for each fund if they failed to review each. Each reject with the fun timely, then that could potentially expose us to market risk.

"Hi today I would like to go over how to make a delicious pot of coffee. First I would suggest reading your coffee pots owners manual and determine. The size of cup of coffee that the machine makes. Many coffees on the market. Consider a cup of coffee to be 5 or 6 ounces. So this is critical when determining how much coffee to make for your party. So the first step would be to add the water to your machine once you determine. So say for example you would like to make eight cups of coffee at 8 ounces of, I'm sorry, 8 cups of water into the machine. When adding the Coffeetime machine, I would suggest using one scoop of coffee. Compared to the number of. I'm sorry, one scooped less of coffee compared to the number of total cups of coffee you were looking to make. So for example, if you're looking to make 8 cups of coffee, then use 7 scoops of coffee. Added to the machine, and then the last step, which is a little secret that I learned from Alton Brown from the Food Network, I add salt to my coffee. I would add one twist of salt from a salt shaker for every cup of coffee that you plan to make. This helps reduce the bitterness. Hit brew and your pot should be ready in a few minutes. Enjoy. So your hot cup of coffee is now prepared for everyone, and hopefully no one. Fills a cup of coffee that you have potentially 16 ounces and they fill it to the rim.",5.0

"Finding the sweet spot and the bigger why behind everything what we do is my way of working and thinking as a designer. And of course it's also my way. But I plan my team or that I wanna bring my team too. And that's the idea that I have for my team. So the plan for my team is actually to bring together the people and to have that is empathetic approach and to bring it together with the company side and our client side. And in the end I want every single person to have the possibility and bring them to sparkle and only by printing every single person to sparkle. My idea is. To let the whole team sparkle and even grow their, uh, sparkle and with this to create an environment of inspiration and environment of. Great designed products. I want my design team to be proud of the work that they do and I want them to inspire each other and have this yeah. Working environment that they can evolve, they can bring themselves in with everything they have by focusing on the strength that they have instead of the things they don't know yet. And if this I can make a plan for every single person and to see how is the team set up, build and who can I approach for what. And I my plan is to have a real transparent atmosphere that everybody else knows. How can I support my colleague where he's maybe not so good and bring my strength? And to which of my colleagues am I going to if I need for myself help or if I'm on a project and I can learn from this person so that I understand the strength of every person and every person from within the team?

To have more of this particles because I think if work is only work and only boring and everybody is doing his style and his little like, I'm this person, I'm doing this, it's just not fun and I I believe this is not the way that humans are being built.

"Hi, welcome back again. My name is Melanie Warren, and today I'm going to talk to you about how to make brownies from a box first and foremost. Get the box of brownies from the store. Once you get the box of brownies, you turn it over and you read the instructions. The end. No, I'm just kidding. It really is that simple, but just to break down the steps a little bit more for you. First thing you want to do is prepare your work station. You want to make sure that you have a clean area where you have enough room for you to mix all your ingredients and make the batter and put them into the oven. You wouldn't also prepare by preheating your oven and making sure that you have all the ingredients that you're going to need as well as all the materials, meaning you're measuring spoons and stuff like that. The next thing you want to do is you want to look at the back of the box to tell you how much of each ingredient. Once you do that, you take your measuring utensils and you measure, and then you put them all in a bowl and pretty much just mix everything up, either with a blender or with a hand spoon. It's really up to you what you choose to use to mix everything, but you want to get everything to a really good consistency in a really smooth blend. Once you're at that stage, are you going to take your your, your baking pan that you're going to put into the oven? You're going to pour the mixture in there, you're gonna level it out so everything is a little smooth, or you going to open up your preheated oven. And you're gonna put the brownie pan in the oven, and you're gonna close the oven, and then you're gonna set your timer for about 26 to 30 minutes, roughly about the 26 minute mark. You gonna go and take either a knife or toothpick open, and you're going to test your brain is to see if they're done. It's really simple. You just take your fork, you put it in, and you put it out. If it comes out clean, it's done. If not, you keep doing it every couple of minutes until you come out with a clean fork, which come up with a clean fork. You've just baked your brownies. Look at you. You're. Own Baker. Congratulations. Let them cool and enjoy.",5.0

With me as a seller and account manager to collectively get to that 1.1 million bigger in the business. Tricky job for sure, but a team. They don't really care about the numbers. They care about the people. They care about their people being us, and they care about the people who they're serving, which is their customers. Around the clock, late, early, whatever it is. There, there and they provide the value that I haven't seen in any other team before. I'm extremely impressed with this team. Uh, there's huge potential to grow even more. I'd love to see how they deal with 2.2 million uh, the target taking two days away from the holiday. How interesting that will get.",

I've seen your courage, I've seen your work great. I've seen the quality and standard that you're providing our customers. I've seen that throughout. It has come to my attention the past two weeks. That is a lot of slack. There's a lot of mistakes and of course, like any football player or rugby player, sports player, they make mistakes. And that's OK. But if it's happening consistently and the ball keeps getting dropped, usually the player gets dropped. Maybe it's me, maybe it's the team, maybe its customers, maybe it's something going on on in your life, but we need to get back up to that level. Can you tell me what do you think are the reasons? Why I'm seeing lower performance and am I completely mistaken? And tell me more about that. In a magical world where you're completely satisfied with your career, your job, and you are a high performer. What do you need in a magical world to get there to that level if nothing?

"When you're 17 entering college, it's difficult to know where you'll end up, and often in life we take a different path than we originally thought. I plan to become a CPA and have my own company to allow for flexibility in my life. In my junior year, though, I realized that I really didn't want to spend all my time crunching numbers all day. I was pretty far along in my credits at that point, and so I decided to stick it out and get my degree in accounting 'cause it's never bad to have a degree in accounting upon graduation. I went for a series of informational interviews at the suggestion of a mentor who thought I might enjoy advertising, which was certainly more fun. It was great to work with project management and work with creatives, um, developing client relationships. And so when I was offered a job, I took it. That started my career in advertising and marketing. Along the way I met some really great people and clients, and when I was offered a job on the client side, I jumped at the chance. It didn't hurt that it was more money and it was closer to home, which was good because flexible arrangements at that time were scarce. So after a series of roles in financial services. Marketing and communications. I landed here at purging and I'm thankful. For the opportunity and the and the. The fact that the environment has changed to allow a little bit more flexibility, essentially bringing me back full circle. I work with the CEO and the CEO on their communications, their presentations, their social media management meetings. And it really brings the best of project management. My analytic brain. That was honed through my accounting degree as well as writing and communications. So that's how I ended up in the career that I'm in today.",6.0

However, I have a plan for how to get there. My first. Course of action is to scope. The responsibilities of the department. It's a brand new department and to scope the roles and responsibilities for me and for each of my team members. I then need to discuss with stakeholders, with my team, with my boss. What is the work that needs to be done. And then get up to speed on what does everybody working on what is the work that needs to be done. Once I have a really good understanding of what that is. Then I can outline a mission for the department that everything else can align to. I will work on with the team members to set goals for the rest of the year so that we have something to work towards that along with our mission and along with the goals of the company and then within the next month or two we will start working on goals for next year that we can all onto. I will work with the team to identify best practices. Appropriate ways of working and set expectations. Not only my expectations of them, but also have clear expectations from them of what they expect from me as their manager. Will outline best ways of working for meetings. How to make our meetings the most efficient so that we're not wasting anyone's Tom and that we make sure that we have the right people in those meetings. How we communicate as a team. Communication is critical and we need to make sure that we have the best ways of working and streamlining communication internally. Well, work on a way to have visibility into their day-to-day. I do not believe in micromanaging, but do like to have visibility so that I understand where they may or may not need support. And then I will set and document processes and procedures not only for our department, but because its operations start working towards that for other departments, other cross functional departments as well. I will come to an agreement with each of my team members how they want to handle one on ones, what is the structure that they prefer that works best for them, what do they want the focus to be? And then will communicate those things as well, so from my perspective so that we can meet in the middle. And then I will look at inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement within their scope of work, within the department's scope of work and then work out a plan of actions that were continuously improving all of our processes and procedures. 1 area that I need to get better at is growth.

I believe in leading through asking questions and understanding the Court issues, seeking input from the team and making thoughtful decisions. I believe in being a servant leader. It's important for me to set an example and lead with that example instead of just expecting people to behave or work in a way that I am not setting myself to the same standard and I believe in empowering my team.

"My department was recently. Dissolved, for lack of a better word, and our company has gone through a restructure. There is a brand new department. That is what I'm now in charge of with new people in that department. This just happened yesterday, so the roles are not scoped. That is something that we are working toward. I can't, so I cannot speak to the current state of the rules on my team. However, I can't speak to the vision that I have in the future for the team. I envision a team that. And operations team that works cross functionally together. So I would have a specialist in these sales OPS role focusing on these sales processes and systems specialist in the product OPS area, focusing all the operations around our product launches, someone in service OPS to focus on our service delivery portion of our business and marketing OPS to focus on our marketing operations and business development efforts. I would also imagine our service delivery component and our sales support falling underneath these areas and really promoting process improvement, following process and having adequate and accurate data. The focus of the department is to streamline all of our operations, from soup to nuts. So looking at all of our cross functional processes, whether it's our sales process or service delivery process, our staffing process, but looking at those specific processes and identifying ways to automate and streamline.

Maybe your morale is a little bit low. 19 goals or ultimately on track to be impacted. So tell me a little bit about what's going on. Is there a specific problem internally that's contributing? Is there something outside of work contributing? I really want to understand what's going on so I can figure out how I can help you. OK, so let's get to the root cause of the issue and will set a plan and will get you back on track. So you say you aren't getting what you need from the service department. So what we're going to do is we're going to reach out to that department via e-mail, CC me, see the head of the department, and let's see if we can't get. Blood.

Caddy with each other and start to not be direct and clear on what our expectations are of each other. And because of that, things get lost in translation. Something that's really hard is being able to give feedback in a way that is constructive and easily digestible. But it is also very hard to receive feedback. So one of the plans I have is to provide some sort of training or education. For my team, in order to better understand how to give feedback and how to best receive feedback in a way that is productive, that way is construct that it's. Constructive and also easier to digest. I hope that that will help my team drastically improving communication and hence be able to improve in output and performance.",6.0
"As a manager, my philosophy is giving space for my employees to grow. Many of the times, myself included, we work in environments where there is no room for mistakes. There is a lack of trust when it comes to management versus lower level employees and. People are afraid to take risks, and because of that you don't get people's best performance. You don't get people having creative ideas flowing, you don't allow them to see where their limits are, and you don't allow them to explore and develop a better connection with themselves, with the work, and with their teammates.

"So my team that I work with at Bellevue Hospital is for the most part pretty amazing depending on who you're working within any given day. But most of my colleagues are such team players. They're always willing to do more than half of their fair share of work. They we support each other, we care about each other and we care about the patients that we work with. And it's evident in how we work together. You never find that you're drowning in work and someone is sitting. There, not willing to pick up any of the slack. It's always all hands on deck, everyones, always all in and people are always volunteering to take on the next task of course. There's maybe always one or two people who. Don't always want to do so much work, and those people do bring down the rest of the team. They're the ones who would rather hand off the work to somebody else, take a nap in the middle of the day. I know, not acceptable or just complain a lot. And honestly, those are the people who are hardest to manage. I don't really know what to do with them, so of course if you have any advice I would love to hear it. But otherwise, for the most part we're doing pretty well, especially without having any upper level management available to us since one of our upper level managers is on maternity leave. So we've been having to navigate things mostly on our own these days and you know. We scheduled ourselves or calendar no one where the psychiatric emergency room so. You know, we we make our own schedule and we always have to make sure there's enough people filling in at any given time and we're all working together in a very collaborative way to make sure that that schedule is pulled together and everyone is on board and we have enough people on staff on any given day.",

I also do consultation calls. Um. You know, I also give presentations and workshops and run my social media and marketing. And now that I'm listing this, all is actually a lot of things for one person to do.

"As a product manager and not a manager with direct reports, my plan for any given team has to be focused on one particular project at that time of year. Um. At this time of year, the project will be our annual report, which were used for potential partners to learn about us as a nonprofit. So for this project I worked with car product Director, technology and Communications director and a marketing and graphics specialist to craft the perfect for port for the past year. My plan starts with a kickoff meeting with every member of the team. To communicate the goals of the project and at this point I open the floor to feedback. I get feedback from everyone on the very best method of solving the project problem. At that point I get a sense of everyone's time and availability and what they're currently working on & initial wave of tasks based on everyone's availability and time they can dedicate. At that point will work for two weeks before a follow up meeting. We follow that cycle of two weeks work and then a follow up meeting until our initial goals. Start to shift and slowly shrink the team as our goals focus so this respects everyones time. I communicate with everyone in between follow up meetings to make sure that people are on the right track and everything is going the way it should and just to make sure no one needs any help as well. So I make sure I do plenty of communication, respect for people's time and I always listen to make sure that they don't need anything from me. Once the project is wrapped up we collect as a group and we present our finished project to. The leadership team, so that everyone who has worked on the project and touched the project can show off their side of it and we can get feedback from our leaders together. Um, I feel like at this point when we are unified and presenting our final work, it brings a lot of motivation to the table and really shows the final result to the people who have worked on it.",5.0
"When I started as an intern in the publishing industry and moved all the way to Assistant Hood and then just advanced out in different industries as well, I became very custom to bosses who did three things. They didn't have empathy for their assistance, um, they didn't have a respect for our time and they did not communicate their needs well. So. Going from that, all of my issues with EMM kind of boiled down to those 3 categories. As a manager, my goal is to be in the opposite direction from those categories. So I managed in the philosophy of empathy, communication and respect for time. For empathy, I always try to be mindful of people struggles and treat people like people for communication. I always want to make sure we're on the same page and just making sure they don't need anything from me or I don't need anything from them and they know the expectations and respect for time.

"I feel the team has gone above and beyond in preparing the report this year, first starting with our product team. Our product director and the counselor manager have both been absolutely imperative in coordinating with me and getting the data and information I need. Um, we run so many camps and courses a year and there's so much information that I, as an executive assistant product manager, don't really get to see up close. So it's been really great to have that perspective to be able to talk. With both of them and really get the first person perspective on how the counselors have been operating and how our different programs have been working throughout 2021. Next, focusing in on our tech team, our technology implications director and our marketing specialists have also been just so fantastic to work with. Our tech director has gotten me all the data I need in such a short amount of time and he's really gone to the next level to get even more data and to help with visualizations. So I've really appreciated his help. Our marketing specialist has really surprised me. I know she's always produced amazing work, but the work she's made for the report has really been absolutely just fantastic. I really think we need to do more to keep err on the team and make sure she's happy because she's such a valuable asset to our team. Um, I can't imagine us operating without her. The report in general is just so visually stunning beyond. What I imagined it to look like, and we even have a PDF version coming up, so her execution and dedication to the report has really amazed me, and she's always been so willing to meet with me despite any difficulties in her schedule. So as a whole, this team has really gone above and beyond and made their dedication clear, and I really commend their efforts. Um, they've been fantastic.",
"My boss is the Chief operating officer at connected camps by company UM, so he's in charge of handling all of our financial and organizational operations from top to bottom. Um. He manages the tech team, the tech director, UM. He's also the manager of the product director. He is my manager. I'm the people administrator and also an executive assistant project manager, and he also manages our contractor who works on a side project called Paychecks UM. So he coordinates with us directly to get a sense of how. Each department is doing what our struggles are, what is working, and then starts problem solving. From an executive POV, he really takes the time to figure out what do we need to do next to get to where we need to go and what kind of processes we need to put in place to make sure we don't encounter the same difficulties again. So I think from the executive standpoint he's a master strategist and also just an overseer. Of our operations.",

And this conversation can definitely stay between us. Um, were requested and where you need it. Um. You know what happens here stays here. Um, but I've noticed lately that you haven't been quite as engaged as you typically are you. Normally you are the first to respond and meetings, you are always on time, you're always smiling and you're always just like that sunny presence. So I wanted to check in and make sure that you are both feeling alright, that you were doing OK and personal life and also feeling motivated in your role. I know this is a difficult time. And it's been really hard lately for many people, so I know all the time, you know, it could be something at home. Um. But whatever it is, I just want to make sure that you are OK.

However, we can get backed up to here where you usually are as such a great performer for us. So, um, yeah, I just really wanted to check in with you and get your thoughts and feelings on how things are going. And also maybe we can make a game plan, right, how we can move on from there?",6.0
"OK everyone, let's get right and do this. So we need one person to handle each corner of the puzzle. I can take the bottom left. You take the top, roughed. You take the bottom right and you take the bottom the top right. So we each focus on our corner. If there is a piece that you think does not belong to your corner, put it in this sense or pile over here. If there's a piece that you think does belong, you grab it and keep it in your corner. Make sure your pieces are visible to the other players so they can see your pieces, and make sure. That you don't have any of theirs. Make sure you start at the edges. So start where the puzzle has edges and then work into the center. I'll be looking over everyone over the puzzle as a whole to make sure we're headed in the right direction. Try not to panic. Try to move with logic and care instead of trying to rush to be the fastest. I know this is a speed challenge, but if you keep your mind focused and keep motivated, you will succeed. So best of luck and let's do the best we can.",6.0
"OK, let's start. Hey, so my plans for the team? In general, I would say the main priority for myself and the team. Should be feeling comfortable in the team. Whatever topic you're working on, whatever your responsibilities is. Or are. You should feel comfortable. Because you can be the best worker. If you're in a team and you cannot work with anyone together. It does not bring us forward so. I will focus at first more on the soft skill sets, eh? That we get along because then we can also work together on tasks we can distribute. We can see where are the strings where the. The. Not the strengths of each person. Um. So. If I would say at first, soft skills in getting along, getting to know each other. That we built a very good and strong bond between each other. The second part, of course, is. Getting all the skills for the tasks they are doing and working on. So like I said, with the first part, we have to see who can do what, who feels comfortable in doing what, challenging. Maybe that also. But mainly soft skills then. Heart skills. I don't know if that's the right word for it. Um, so we can definitely see some progress. We have some timelines for each topic. And that I think we have to individually then figure out what makes sense, what we can push, what we cannot push prioritize. Um. But in the end, my overall goal is the cassette soft skills. Then the tasks they're working on and hopefully then. I can help them develop. So by the time they may be leaving my team. They are saying. This has brought me forward in my career. This is taught me something this. This is something they will always look back to with pleasure. Um. I think that would be my ultimate goal. Yeah. And I can definitely say my current manager is doing quite a fantastic job for that, so I will definitely. Take some ideas and some exercises that she already has done into consideration.",3.0
"It was marked, if that's the right word, but also my current manager and the way the team is working that IE grew into um. So we mostly do an agile scrum based approach. So we have for example daily standups. Which I think is nice. So we we do not talk about what? Every meeting that we had, but what topic we were working on, the main topic and if you had problems. I don't want to do micromanagement because that's definitely a bad thing. Um, I want. That everybody feels comfortable enough. To have no weekly syncs with me or something, tell me where there are problems serving, where the questions are where they do not know how to move on. Um. But in the end I don't want to be. Too much controlling them. Yeah.",3.0
"OK. So my team is responsible for the power platform. Um, the rules that we have in there are quite easily distinguished. Me? Yes. Domain owner of it, of course, if the whole platform.

He also is. In the role of taking the, um, QA. Um in there. So everything that we do with testing, setting up our systems from live to QA so that we can really test and change things. And then there is also Thomas, he will be basically appear to myself. So if I'm not there or anything, as an owner he is there and we also distribute the main topics between ourselves. So for example also coming to data privacy workers Council, stuff like that. So in total we have around four people. And of course the support of working students for smaller tasks like creating a document or something. But in general these are. Yeah, the main roles and distributions in in my team.",

I cannot try to help you or we cannot see how we can distribute maybe responsibilities or tasks new and the team. Whatever it is, you're not alone. And if you're just feel overwhelmed with your tasks. Also no problem, just you need to talk to me then we can figure it out. What we can do is next steps so. Yeah, please let me know. Otherwise.

"I want to have a team that enjoy the work that they are doing. They wake up in the morning and they look forward to coming to work and. Whether they're working from home or in the office, I want them to. Get on with and to work well with the people and their their colleagues that they work with. And my. Approach to getting my team to work well is through a sort of democratic philosophy, and that is to check that. People are feeling both OK with work they're doing in the workplace, but also that things are OK personally for them. And that doesn't mean going into a lot of detail on their personal matters, but just getting a feel for how they're doing. And that would involve checking in regularly with them, having conversations with them, as many of those face to face as possible. And during those conversations, just trying to draw out. As much from them as I can through an opening kind of transparent. Culture which I would be looking to create for my team and it's that's a long term process, creating that culture of transparency and openness between my team and myself, but also between. My team themselves, and part of that is to find out as well, um, to get them to enjoy the work they're doing is to find out how each individual works best at what they've kind of favorite approaches. And their preferred method of working is whether that's working in the office or staying at home or what it is they're working on. So some people may prefer the sort of. Black and white sort of numerical tasks more than those who prefer the qualitative tasks and through conversation. That is, how would I understand that?",3.0
"My management philosophy is a democratic philosophy and. That is founded on the belief that people are your greatest assets and so it's very important to ensure that they are thriving in the work they do and then they come back from home feeling. More satisfied than when they first went to work in the morning? Um. The best way to do that, I think, is to seek feedback and input from your team and use that to make decisions and make those decisions visible to the team. That way your team will feel empowered and enabled to act proactively, but also just to make decisions on their own. And it's important to me as well as part of this democratic philosophy, that when they make those decisions, they feel able to make those decisions. And if they make the wrong decision, that they don't get blamed for it. That's my management philosophy.",5.0
"The team are doing. Very well at the moment I think they are. They understand their new roles and particularly, um, Laura moving up into a more senior position and Harry taking on more responsibility. From what I've handed him, um, I think individually Harry is still very enthusiastic. He's very keen to take on new work. He. Produces very good work. The emails that I see going out, the various reports that he's fed into, his comments on those reports, UM, I think he possibly could ask a few more questions. And in doing so, I want those questions to be a clear indicator that he has taken a step to look into whatever the problem is before he comes to me with those problems. A lot of the time answers to those questions are. Um, very easily found, but otherwise I think he's doing very well. Um, Laura again produces fantastic work. She's a fantastic communicator. She's. Very able to talk with a large group of different personalities in a room, um, and help bring together to achieve a common goal. There. She can be. Um, some of our opinions and um her approaches to people? When? The matter at hand isn't ideal for her. Can sometimes seem confrontational. Um, but I think that is a side of her that shows she's passionate to get the results she wants. And. That eventually, despite those. Points of confrontation, she does deliver on what she sets out to do.",

"Hi. Thanks for joining the meeting. I just wanted to check how you're doing. Really? Um. Good. OK, well, I wanted to ask how things were because I wanted to check that everything is OK with you and. And the reason for that is that I've noticed, eh? Change in your performance over the last couple of months and in particular it it seems that you have been struggling to match the performance that. You were showing. Before this. Um. Does that ring any bells? Does that does that make you feel? Um, how does that make you feel? I think, um, there have been a couple of examples that I can I can give their. There was the two reports last week which had asked for on Friday and they obviously only came through this morning and there are a few more examples of that where deliverables were late and as I say you were kind of matching the performance we expected. Before this last couple of months, but it's just over the last couple of months, there's been a bit of a concern over how things are for you because there have been a few missed milestones. Um. Your attitude in the meeting last Thursday seemed particularly negative. Um. And it's affecting some of the team. So I've heard from some of the team that um. Your attitude in that meeting in particular, had made them feel. Um. Worse than they did before. So I just wanted to check in and see if anything had changed recently. Um.",3.0
"OK, can you number one please find the corner pieces 1st and put them out on the corners and then look for all of the edge pieces and will start piecing those together. Can remember #2 you look for all of the tiger pieces? I think the best way to do this would be to look for the orange and black. Just try and grab all of those orange and black sand. Make a little pile just here. And then team member #3, if you can do the same but for the polar bear, grab all of the lighter colored pieces. It doesn't matter if you accidentally pick up some of the tiger pieces. We can sort that out afterwards, but make a pile of the polar bear pieces. Just here I will help out with the corners and the edges. I think we need to get those in place first. And then once we've got all these corners and edges lined up, everybody help, peace, all those corner and I just beat this together. And then we'll start with the positioning of the inner pieces, go with the tiger 1st and then the polar bear. Is that OK with everyone?",5.0
"In my team, I think the priority will be objectives. I am very objective through in person and I would like to reflect that as part of the values of the team. Therefore, I would like to be surrounded from people or surrounded by people that are also very, very objective driven, but not in a bad kind of way, that also have some interpersonal capabilities and that behave as a team, not as an army. Of people, er of independent entities. So I would like to promote that kind of environment where Excellencies is is the driving force, but also interpersonal skills. I think having a common reference framework and having some. At least similar standards in terms of quality and how to approach. Things makes things quite easy when when you are talking about a team. So in general my management strategy also is going to be hands off because I think that good people or valid people don't need micromanagement. They will be able to behave themselves and take the initiative from their own. So in summary, if I have to summarize a hands off and promoting. Ah, I'm preserving excellence.",4.0

"So my team is focused on all the security or T stands for Operation Technology and that is every device that can control or monitor a productive process. So at the end of the day, this means I take care of the security of the factories. When I say, I mean I as a team, my team is focused in or spread, global, globally spread. We have colleagues in the US. We have a 1 colleague in the Asia Pacific region, specifically in China. And then because most of the factories are in Europe, we have three more colleagues in in this region. So two of them in Germany, one in Spain, which is myself. And they um. The the. Take the way we help factories improve their service. Security is through an assessment process. We have developed an internal tool to be able to assess their security maturity of a factory and we use that tool to systematically approach all of the manufacturing locations, understand how critical they are, and based on that criticality and their current security status, we can then propose action plans that will help them improve that security. And our involvement does not finish here. We help the factories implemented those action plans. So, for example, if they have to roll out a certain cybersecurity tool, we our team. Specifically there people that he is responsible for each of the regions. We will guide them through the installation process, the configuration process and through the operation. So we take care and to end up cybersecurity in manufacturing locations and of course this is in combination with local teams that support us a lot during this task.",

"So hi, how are you doing? I have set up this meeting because I wanted to talk about your performance lately. I know there are some things currently in your life that may be impacting the way you behave at work. But nevertheless, I wouldn't want to let it sleep any anymore because this is not helping you or helping us as a team to improve and comply with our objectives at the end of the day. So. As I was saying, lately I've seen that you are a little bit distracted maybe what? What are your thoughts? Um. Yeah. I mean, their workload is quite huge at this moment and it's very hard to focus on one single topic, but the fact is that the things on the deliverables that you are taking care of our having very reduced inequality lately, so. You are you make me use to to a standard and I think our customers are also used to a certain standard coming from from your from your work I'm coming from your side but lately this standard hasn't been met or has been dropped. So I would I would like to to to ask you to think about what can be it can be impacting those that quality. And also let me know if there is something that I as a manager can do because maybe in reprioritization of activities would help getting back on track, or maybe, maybe not just. I think that that part has to be solved and also the second part is the. Wow, your behavior, your behavior. Lately, it's been a little bit more passive, a little bit more absent.

Then I need another person taking care of searching everything that is orange and everything that is orange and black and then the other person is going to take care of. Searching for everything that is white. So once you have reformed that that search, we put everything together in place and start building the puzzle together.

"Hi everyone. Um. So I guess my plan for my team. Uh. Typically just involves being. As efficient or I guess it's striking a balance between being as efficient, um, with your time as possible, but also making sure that you are investing in your teams development. So it's striking a balance of those two things. Um. And I think, um. Transparency around. Process is really critical to that, so making sure that everyone is understanding the key goals and output requirements. And also understanding of exactly which tasks they should be focused on and when. Um, I think. Actually, if you do that and everyone is able to use their time efficiently, um, you actually have more room to. To sort of focus on developing your team, um. Because with that extra time you gains order that that. Additional bandwidth to UM invests in your people? Um. Continue to refine the work that they've done, provide feedback to them, and have them be able to use that feedback to improve their work. Rather than it being a rushed process. Um, where? You know, as a manager you would go and change everything yourself directly if it's not if it's not looking right, but you actually do have time for a feedback loop, so I actually think, you know, being efficient in time, time wise, um. Is is driven by a clear understanding of the process, but that also enables you to actually invest in your team more.",5.0
"So I would say my manager philosophy I touched on a little in the prior um video for your plan I think. To recap that, I think you know being efficient with your time and investing in your in your team is important. Um, but outside of that I would say um. As a manager, um, it's really important to. Not be the kind of manager that's sort of just simply directing the team. Um, think an important part of being a manager is also contributing to the actual output. Most of the time when I see and since it's a burn on a project, it's because the manager is not actually contributing to the output per southeast. In terms of like slide development and analysis. So I actually think that um, playing that dual role of a manager and also part time essay, um can actually be really important.",4.0
"So for this project we have a team of four people. Um, we've got. Two essays, senior associates and we've also got two experienced associates. Um, two of our associates, mark an ABDL will be leading the main 2 workflows of this project. Obviously, Mark is a little more new to his role here and so he's going to be mostly focused on the SWOT analysis, which is more qualitative in nature. He doesn't have as much experience as. Other folks who've been here longer, um, when it comes to quantitative market modeling, however, he does have a significant amount of experience in both strategy and. And I think in that respect, he's going to make a great lead on the SWOT analysis. Um. Then on the other side, you have Abdel that will be leading the market modeling exercise and he's been here for awhile. So he definitely understands the typical process flow of what that looks like and the key requirements. For it. And there's also been looking to gain sort of more experience. So I think that also feeds into his own development areas that he's looking to get out of this. Um, in addition to that, we've also got our two EAS. Michelle is one of them and Zach is the other. And each of them will sort of be working with Mark and Abdel just to sort of foster closer team relationships, but also to make sure that Mark and Abdel always have someone to help assist them and make sure they're progressing.

"So my boss is a role encompasses a number of different, um components to it. So obviously the 1st as a director or rather a Managing director, his job is increasingly to focus on developing client relationships and in that vein helping to sell additional work for our group. So that's that's part of it. In addition to that, he also sort of helps to lead. The business development efforts affectively creating pitch decks on potential projects that we send out to perspective clients. And then thirdly is to sort of offer more insight and expertise on project areas to make sure that our work is fully capturing the nuances of an industry where he has some more experience maybe than some of the rest of the team.",
"So in having a conversation with this, um, so the first thing that I would do is I would I would schedule, schedule a meeting with with the team member and also just initially just check in and see how they're doing and see how they feel their performance has been. I think establishing that up front is really important just to understand you know contextually and from their perspective. You know how they feel things have been going and why? Um, prior to providing harsh feedback. Um, once I had a better understanding of that. I would. You know, I would sort of call out potentially a couple of areas where, you know, I think they're there, may be doing well, but then also stressed the importance of, um, you know, areas where they've maybe been underperforming, but also really communicate to them that for their own development like ownership of a workstream or work just generally is, is really important and you know, convey that that's something. They need to be stepping up. I think it's really about, um, communicating and stressing the importance of ownership. And once you address that, I feel like a lot of those issues can resolve themselves a little bit more. Um, and yeah, and then obviously also ask them if there's anything that I can do to make it easier for them to. Perform better.",4.0
"OK, so I think if we have a clear division of roles and also keep communication open between all of ourselves, we should be able to get this puzzle done. Really well. And ideally, let's see if we can beat the other teams. Who knows? But we'll give it our best shot. An and so by lines of communication, I just mean, you know, if you're working on one part of the puzzle and you find a piece that that seems like, you know, someone else on the team is missing it. You know, let's keep those lines of communication open, make sure everyone can get the pieces they need. Um. But generally, I think if we sort of split this puzzle up so that one person is focused on the polar bear and another person is focused on the tiger, and then you have, you know, someone else that's focused on the background image, that should be a good way of splitting up the team and making sure that everyone is focused on the right things and then also be there overseeing it and helping to build in the puzzle and fill in pieces were needed.",4.0

On the second hand, the second project is defined, which are our interactions between the different teams that will be our stakeholders. Those would be. Our colleagues from the security team, our colleagues from the monitor and detect team and the sea, so which is going, who is going to receive our REPORTES also.

Not in time, so I would like to know if there is something with which I can help you to improve it and try to finish it in the deadline that we have so. Um, please, I would like to review with you which is the process that you follow, if there's anything that we can improve there to help you to achieve those goals and. See? Eh? How can you? Do your best. So. Um. I would like to know if it is something that water you or if you have detected anything that could be. That could be an stop under super for you, or if it is because there are some parts that you don't understand so well and you want to go deeper on that. Um. Well. I need that you understand that this part is so important for us and we really need this. I mean, we really need to finish these reports in the deadlines because their reports are needed for the executive level and without them they cannot make their own decisions, informative so. I need that you understand which is the criticality of these kind of reports and why we really need it on those dates. I hope it can help you. I can help you and see what is wrong. I'm fighting both it as much as possible.",3.0
"So here we are. Let's go into win this competition. Um, we need to pull these puzzles, so I think that it's important than any each of you have and specific responsibility in this play. I think that the best way to. Solve this problem is starting with the corner, so maybe an option could be that it's of you be responsible of 1 corn and in this way we can then work together on that and please trust your mates. I think that it's important so also and the other point is that one person needs to be the leader so it's important that you can decide. Someone that could help you don't analyze it a little bit and make decisions when there is a disagreement there.",3.0
"Lisa is from San Francisco. She's the CFO for an insurance company out of Connecticut. So navigating between the two locations has been quite a challenge. Especially in a sales environment, since they have an active evaluation for a new investment accounting engine. Antiquated technology is the main driver for that project. They're trying to drive operational efficiency and reduce costs in the interim, but logistically it has been a huge challenge navigating between the three time zones in which Lisa is traveling through. It's been a huge issue dealing with her P eh, who's a remote employee in the center of the United States and overall, I've been trying to get FaceTime with Lisa, which makes things a little bit more compelling when you're presenting numbers and. Projected revenues and projected cost savings, etc. So my plan is to be wherever she is and offer myself up wherever possible.",6.0
"As part of any technology evaluation, there's going to be an inherent cost saving, revenue driving or operational efficiency play for Lisa. I think all three buckets of those will be applicable to her search. And with BNY Mellon, we're well positioned in all three areas, production of costs by outsourcing their operations for alternative investments, it will be easy for Lisa to then justify sunsetting legacy infrastructure. And re routing employees that are currently supporting the process to better, more efficient areas, operational efficiency wise, there would be less infrastructure and less data integration for her to worry about, which will be ultimately taking off of her plate. And from a revenue generation standpoint, she will be able to reallocate some of the resources that are doing a lot of the busywork nowadays and re-route them into more revenue driving front office types of activities.",6.0
"BNY Mellon has $45 trillion of assets under custody and or under administration. And when you peel back from there and look at some of our desperate product sets, for instance, the Eagle product or the data vault product or the global Risk services product, um, there are significantly more assets to speak of within that functional suite. For instance, on Eagle, we have 160 clients across data management. Performance measurement and investment accounting. And on our data vault, which was only launched 2 years ago, we already have multiple trillion dollar managers that are leveraging the platform for a variety of different use cases. This is public cloud data management. We've partnered with Microsoft Azure. We've made things easy and repeatable. So if you look at the larger BNY Mellon under management, under custody number and compare it to vault. We see tremendous upside.",6.0
"I'm sorry that you are unclear about our value proposition. That's ultimately my fault and I apologize for not articulating that better out of the gate. A couple of points there. One is our core messages are true across the entire organization from the CEO, Robin, Vince, all the way down across divisions and you think about the divisions of BNY Mellon, we've got investment management. We've got broker dealer type of arm with with the purging folks. We've got outsourced services, we've got financial technology and everything in between. We are razor focused on making sure that we are saving. Clients money in every possible engagement we are driving revenue for those clients and we are mitigating risk and driving operational efficiency. So all of those things, regardless of what your relationship is with the bank, you will hear that across our entire suite of services.",4.0
"We currently have a policy of anywhere from 10 to 20 days of paid vacation time, and while the take what you want vacation approach is appealing, probably not likely for a organization of our complexity and size. So at the very least, if we could consider an additional week for all employees, this would be a really significant cultural gain within the organization. Employees would feel. Relieved, they would feel proud. They would brag to their friends that I work for a great company that's just giving us an extra week of vacation for really no apparent reason. And you know on the concern side when you look at costs and you look at time lossed across the the organization of 50,000 plus employees. You could argue that that. Outweighs the benefit, however. Cultural benefits are not measured in dollars and cents. Keeping employees important is the most important thing.",4.0
"In my experience when it comes to paid time off and vacation days. The startup culture actually has this right. Employees don't want to feel like they're trapped or beholden to an organization. They want to feel empowered by that organization and like there are significant part of the ownership stake within that organization. So as such, um. I take what you want. Holiday policy is the way to go. Um, you're going to find that employees overtime will actually take less holidays because they'll feel more emboldened to be managing the things that are on their plate. And because it's a sort of a don't ask, don't tell policy there. There's benefits to it that are deeply rooted in philosophy and psychology. And people feel like they're going to be being watched, so they're really going to watch themselves, make sure that they don't abuse the system.",5.0
"So as a manager for my team, but I looking is to treat to build a relationship between all the team members that could create an environment of high efficiency. What I mean with that is. Um. There is. A methodology that is called Agile methodology's. You know to create um team, team buildings and in order to create team, sorry and in order to create environments for working. That I would like to implement with within my team and I would like to be the one driving. The way of creating this kind of teams. Usually when you're following another methodology, there is a role which usually it is taken by the manager which is the moderator. And someone who is the technical lead also, so everyone within the team can have a guidance in order for them to to know what are the next steps to be followed, but at the same time everyone to have the. Possibility of being open and to share their ideas within that environment. In order to improve or in order to create new project services or ideas that could be. Needed to be taken into consideration. So that's my idea, uh, as a manager and massive er, my idea in order to create. This. Team building.",4.0
"Let's imagine a team. That is making decisions in a consensus way. And also that they are looking ways for improving. In a systematic way. What are the things that can be improved or the one of them needs that need to be? Um, taking into consideration for improving the processes and their way of working. That's actually my philosophy as a manager. I think that everyone within the team should cooperate. They should be open and share what are their their ideas everyone within the team should consider. Um, these ideas and to decide what should be the next steps, so all the decisions that are made within the team cannot be considered as an imposition.",4.0
"We have seen lately in the news um cyber attacks that are happening for example to companies like Uber and Uber is now looking for cyber security specialist in order to protect their services, their assets. In order to avoid disruption of the service. So this is the kind of role that my meeting has. Actually we are cloud cyber security specialist. So that means that. We are in charge of the protection of our cloud environments within Siemens healthineers. And we specialized in different technologies or in different vendors, actually we are we specialize in. Amazon and Microsoft Technologies which is called Azure at our main goal is to try to protect, as I said, the services and processes that we are running their. Uh, in those environments you never listen, Asher. And on the other side, what we need to do is to try to detect possible attackers, hackers there there trying to penetrate our security measures in order to get some kind of benefits. Usually it will be to get to our data, to get to our usual information, whatever it is, in order for them to get a benefit. So that's, you know, not So what is my purpose here in this company? And, um, yeah, talk to you soon.",
"But I believe we all know that cyber security is a very complex problem and issue for many companies and they need cyber security specialist. Um, in order to be able to tackle with this serious problem or their tax coming from different hackers? So my boss is the is in charge of all the cyber security within central seniors. So that means that he needs to find ways for protecting, detecting and then investigated security issues. If they are happening within their company.",
"Hello, Alberto, how are you doing? Today. I would like to talk to you about uh. Difficult situation that I think that we are. Leaving. We need to assess, let's say, some of the different deliverables that you have been creating and on the other side we need to talk about your communication skills and the way that you have in order to. Cooperate with other team members. So the first question that I would like to to make you is. What is your feeling, how you feel about your communication skill and now about the Liberals that you have given um because there have been some complaints, so I would like to know first. What is your opinion about the work that you are doing and the difficulties that you could have? Uh, and after that, where I would like to do is to try to find ways to avoid that. Some of the comments on some of the issues that we had found happen again. So this is nothing personal, is totally about things that are happening. So how we are working on how we are cooperating each other, let's say within the team and that's something that sometimes happens. So I think is the best thing to do is to be honest. Just to try to be transparent about what could be the causes. Why this is happening again and again in a systematic way? And I'm sure. Among us or between us, we can find find ways to improve the situation.",4.0
"So I think that what we need to do, AH, trust, is to try to create the square, the whole square of the puzzle. So the first thing to do is to try to then defy those pieces that have a flat site, right? So we can do this, the four of us. We can do it together. We kind of start doing that this frame, let's say and after that. Probably the best idea is that. A couple of people is, um, filtering, or you're filtering the different puzzle pieces based on colors, so we can put together and the other two can start making the puzzle. Or trying to put the pieces together. When all the pieces are already classified, all of us will continue during the puzzle and let's say. If we have the winners.",4.0
"Connected camps were going through quite. A big transition from being connected camps to becoming the Connected Learning Alliance. And this also involves a shift in business model for more of a consumer focused fee for service model to more of a traditional non profit model and really focused on academic research. My team, which covers administration, operations, technology is moving into more of a shared services type role where they're going to be supporting both the connected camps team and they connected learning, allowing its team. So for me, while that's very early in the planning stages, so we don't have a lot of metrics or specific goals laid out for Connected Learning Alliance, what my plan for my team involves is, eh, helping them through the change. As well as be, um, really understanding role clarity and how they're positioned fits into the bigger picture or the broader scheme for the organization. So we're maintaining our mission, which is to help youth grow and develop through educational technologies, but we're doing it in a very different way and so making sure that people are invested in the vision. In the mission and how we're going about achieving those goals is going to be really important going forward. Um, also going to be very partnership focused, so we'll be working on helping the team improve their skills. When it comes to working with external parties, we've been very internally focused in the past. So we want to make sure that they are comfortable working with external stakeholders and communicating effectively with them. And then lastly, also running events, which again involves a lot of external parties. And making sure that the experience of the people that attend events is a positive one. So a lot of change in the scope of folks rolls. And I want to make sure that I'm there to support them through that and help them get a clearview of what our organization is going to become in the next three to five years and how they can help us get there.",4.0
"My management philosophy really follows, um, little bit of servant leadership, a little bit of situational leadership. I do believe in the inverted pyramid. Um. Idea of management that higher levels of the organization. We should really be there to support the folks that were managing rather than direct what they're doing. Um. So, you know, from a situational standpoint, when I have an employee that is taking on a project that involves something they've never done before, I may spend more time with them and offer more support, more direction. If someone's doing something that they're very comfortable doing, I just get out of their way and make sure they have the resources to do it. I'm also results focused, and that really means, um, being focused on what gets done rather than how and win. I thought I was running out of time. It's flashing. Um, lastly, accountability being clear about expectations. Um, what?",5.0
"There's three things I would share about my team won their adaptable. To their collaborative and three they're trustworthy. I'm very lucky as a manager to have a team like this, um, adaptable. We have gone through quite a bit of organizational change, and this team is willing to take on new challenges. They can handle uncertainty, um, competing priorities, and they just roll with it, which is great. Second, collaborative, they work extremely well with one another, and they work really well across. The organization to make sure that the right people are in the right meetings, the right people are informed about what's going on, and I get a lot of feedback that they're just in general a pleasure to work with. Last of all, trustworthy. Um, never have to worry if I'm handing something off to a team member that whether or not it's going to get done. Um, they always rise to the challenge and do what is asked of them. If they have an issue, they'll come to me and they'll raise it, will talk through it, will work together to make sure that we get any obstacles out of the way. But when I have a deadline to meet and I have folks on my team who have to contribute. Certain things on time and never have to worry about those things happening, which is a huge relief as a manager. So those are the three things that I would I would share about my team or adaptable, their collaborative and their trustworthy.",
"I worked for two Co founders who have full time university jobs in academia. Um, full time. So I'm in charge of most of the day-to-day operations while they are really responsible for high level vision and strategy setting the direction of where we're going and then I have to go and figure out how we implement as a team. As Co founders, they're really the heart and soul of the organization. We have a small team and I think a lot of us are here at connecting camps, not only for the mission, but also because we believe in the work that Katie and Mimi are doing. So another important role of theirs is to really inspire us all as a team to work together. To fulfill the vision and mission that they've sent out.",
"So I want to have a conversation with you about your performance recently. I've noticed that your performance has been slipping. You've really been underperforming what I know you're capable of. Um, there's been several deliverables recently that have been late, and I've also noticed and gotten some feedback that you haven't been collaborating in the most positive way with teammates, and you know that your attitude has been less than ideal. And so I want to just have a conversation about this and give you an opportunity to respond. You don't have to get personal, but if there are things going on in your personal life or outside of work that are making it difficult for you to perform to the extent that you can share that with me, I'd love to be able to support you. Um, I'd love to talk about, you know what? You may need to get back on track because I know, like I said, you're capable. Of performing at a much higher level than you currently are on the other side, the attitude piece or the way you're working with others, you know, that's. That's more concerning to me. Because, you know, late deadlines, if you're, you know, you're out of bandwidth and you need me to help manage your workload, I can step in and do that. But from a company values and culture perspective, you know, the attitude piece is something that you really have to, we really have to address because it's really critical that if there are things going on in your space that we're not negatively impacting our coworkers and that we're honoring the commitments. They've made to the organization and the commitments that we've made to them. So let's go ahead and talk about those things separately.

"OK, here's how we're going to win this puzzle challenge. Ah. Player one wants you to grab all of the white pieces that look like polar bear pieces. Player 2, all the orange, orange, and black pieces that look like tiger pieces. Three and four. I want you to start taking all of the border pieces and assembling the border. I will go ahead and look for any pieces that are not obviously orange or white and look like they could be background pieces. And once we get those altogether, start assembling your sections and the two of you are on the border. Once you are done, jump onto one of the other teams and start assembling either the tiger or the polar bear and figuring out how we can connect them to the border. I will do the same with the background and hopefully. We will beat these other ten teams.",5.0
"The plan for my team. What is a plan? For me, it's a set of guidelines that I use. To deliver on a vision. For me it is #1. Clarity. I need to create clarity. About what needs to happen we're A-Team. We're supposed to do teamwork if you're a soccer team. You need to know. What the goal is, you need to have clarity about. This is the goal that we're going for. We're playing that way. We need to kick the ball into the net. You're going to be playback. You're going to play center, you're going to play or you're going to play midfield, you're going to play forward. So clarity about what needs to happen as a team, but also the individual roles. Now the second thing is purpose. Why do we do that? It's very hard to win a soccer game with players. Who don't feel like it's their purpose, who don't feel like they need to win or were like, I don't like this game. It doesn't align with what it is that I want to do. So the second thing is purpose. Why does this need to happen? How was it good for us as a group, but also, how does it align to you, your own personal goals? And then the third is the yardstick. And the yard stick is how do we know if we played a good game or not? How do we ensure to deliver on our promises? Winning the game makes it very simple. It's or. Winning the match makes it very simple. It's who scores the most goals, but there are other things. Did we play fair? Did anybody get ejected or not? Did we improve from the last time? Did we stick to the game plan? We may have one on a scramble or. And improvisation if you will. But that's not scalable. That's not manageable. So it's not just who scores the most goals and it always looks good on a scorecard or dashboard, but how did we do that? Did we stick to our plan if not that we adjusted, we play fair where we respectful with each other. That's the plan for the team clarity. Purpose and results.",7.0

After something went wrong, I can't immediately say, Oh no, this is how you should have dealt with that particular situation. Ref. Can we take a quick timeout here? Maybe like 15 minutes or so so that I can. No, the thing that we need to do is management. Is created culture and environment for people to thrive and where it's OK to experiment, where it's OK to make. Mistakes. Don't make the same mistake twice or three times over. That would not be good. Create a safe environment and a culture where people want to learn when to experiment went to better themselves because they are on purpose.

"Just after record, I would like to share that the team has grown a lot. We went from a very old fashioned, boring traditional type of training to new ways of engaging with customers that really matters to the customers where customers get the sense that their valued for what they're achieving as well. Most people have stepped up. As you know, I lead two teams. We have a team here in the OS and we have a team in India, and almost everybody in these teams have has stepped up. Um, I'd love that book. Who moved my cheese? Well, their cheese has moved since I took over the team and they were Happer, happy, sometimes even eager to to move along with it. Not everybody is able to make the transition though. They're really stuck in in the way they did. Things they have a hard time envisioning. How what their new reality would would look like. So we have a transition plan. I have a transition plan in place to see if those people can make that leap. If not, we have to find a different person to fill that role, and the person currently in that role can either transition to another part of the company or will have to follow their career or continue their career elsewhere.

The problem is to get people to buy in on somebody else is good idea. And that's her role. Is to navigate with all the good ideas are around the company and then find where the common themes are and then get everybody on board to execute. Execution is frankly not that hard.

In making an acquisition of EH relevant company in their market. And. For us, we want to be able to give our client comfort. That. The portfolio company of theirs that's considering this acquisition. Is doing it for the right reasons. But at the same time we also want to. Make our portfolio company client. Feel that their opinions and investment theses are heard and balanced. Balanced effectively and fairly against everything that we're hearing from the marketplace. So that's those are the overarching goals of project. In terms of team distribution? So we have two senior associates here, and. Three associates. One of the senior associates will be working on the market modeling stream and this will. Be the stream that gives our clients comfort around the size and growth and attractiveness of the market in which this acquisition would would be operating under. And secondly the other senior, so she will be working on the competitive. Analysis workstream and making sure we give comfort around our clients. For the. Attractiveness of the acquisition target. From a competitive perspective and how differentiated they are against their competitors? Overall, these two work streams will give us a net. Net summary story of how attractive the overall access structurally really is. And the associates underneath will be supporting these two work streams with one of the associates. Oh, so make sure they are direct liaison with our third party. Expert networks who are going to give us a lot of the market insights and perspectives to inform our opinions.

"My management philosophy comprises of three points one. I think the manager should give the team enough direction when it comes to deliverables, as well as content and insight and analysis. The team will be relying on the manager to really do that and manager needs to be able to do that very efficiently and effectively. Secondly. A manager should give the team room to. Create and conduct their own analysis and work streams. And to let their creativity. And analytical skills shine of their own accord. And finally. I think the manager should give a culture. A culture of comfort and openness. Across the team so that conflicts and ideas can be cross fertilized. And ultimately resulted in a better outcome.",6.0
"Our team is performing overall quite well, but some things to consider for improvement going forward. In terms of what they're doing well. Say 5 both all five team members are taking great initiative to be. There were streams Dr Daily. Sort of checkins and checkouts and also just tasks and overall work distribution. And also the deliverables in terms of analysis and. And ultimate result of the deliverable looks pretty good. And I would say really what needs a little bit of improvement is that some of the exponent reviews that were conducting there could be further training that each of the Members could be doing in terms of making those as efficient and deeply insightful as possible. And then secondly. On some of the content, I think this is still a newer market in space for a lot of our team members to pick up and understand. So I think there's still requires some more education in terms of marketing industry fundamentals that could be brought on to improve the outcome with the work and there definitely insights. So on those two points will continue before the next readout in two weeks to spend one-on-one time with team members can ensure that they are getting the training. Um, for myself and the other couple more senior folks in the team. You need to make sure that they're getting that training on the interview conducting as well as the.

"Hey there. Thanks for taking this time to check in at 101. So I just wanted to give you a little bit of. So, constructive feedback on our project so far and you're hired. Please stop me and let me know if there's anything we can keep discussing some of these topics. To ensure that we're aligned on the same page with how I'm seeing things and how you're saying so. This is definitely not the end of the conversation. It's not going. Discussion for us to make sure that we're like going forward. And so the first piece of. Feedback was just around. I think some of the deliverables your hand into the team are a bit on the late side. So maybe even if it's a bit of. Sharing that. You give a bit more visibility on your expected. Delivery times for your analysis. Asking better sense of that team would be helpful. And lastly or secondly about the negative attitude that was kind of herd sometimes in terms of on some of our team discussions. It's uh. It sometimes effects team around a little bit and. And. There may be many reasons for that and I don't want to assume. What may be going on in the week? And please, let's have a separate conversation about that to see if there's something that. We can do to help you see the more positive side of. The work that we're doing, the problems ever trying to solve, their client and to see if there's anything we can do to address any misgivings or lack of comfort.

Organization that I am founding is, um, focused on Mohawk and food, which is a state in Mexico with a rich indigenous peoples.

"My management philosophy is to lead from the heart and to lead from behind. Leading from the heart means leading with love, with compassion, with understanding, with trust. And also understanding that trust takes time to build. And that also means seeing my team members as equals. And leading from behind means having the ability to delegate to. Allow people to practice their own leadership styles, to have agency, and to trust that they're going to do the work well. And it also means trusting them that when they need help, they can call on me for help, or they can call and others for help.

To celebrate their initiative, them taking initiative in the project projects that we are working on. And how? That person could also be part of the management team. At some point, because the goal is to also create an organization where we hire within the organization as opposed to looking for talent outside of the organization.

"Right now I don't have a boss. I am the boss, which I actually have a little bit of a personal dislike towards. I'm not into boss culture. I am more into collaborative and cooperative leadership models. Because hierarchies can often allow for power dynamics to exist, and it also puts the onus on one person being the one to know all everything, whereas a more collaborative and less hierarchical structure allows others to also share their creativity, their innovation, and their skills. And also to support. So not a fan of the boss culture, especially the Boss girl, because in my opinion it is also a replica of the toxic masculinity that exists within corporate the corporate world.",
"Hey, Katie. I wanted to have this meeting with you to talk about your performance at the organization and talk about ways that we can support you so that you are also supporting the team and fulfilling your rules. I've noticed that in the last two months you haven't been able to deliver on your responsibilities and that you don't seem too happy being here. And I want to make space for any feedback that you want to give me as your manager and or other team members or perhaps the organization. As we've mentioned from the beginning, this is an Outwell position. So if there's something that doesn't fit your lifestyle or your personal growth or professional growth, then, you know, we want to talk about that. I also want to make space. If there is other stuff that you are contending with and your personal life which you don't have to share any of, but if there is another way to support you, we can definitely talk about that too. I'm thinking that right now what we can do is create a one month plan so that we can support you in reaching the other goals and the KP eyes that we have set for the organization. And we can do weekly checkins with, or we can even do him twice a week, 30 minutes each, um per 30 minutes a day, twice a week, just so that we can track progress and see how we're doing.

"Alright, so today we're going to talk about our plan for the upcoming year. We are going to be focusing on our six pillars, which are part of our health systems pillar goals. And as a team, remember, if you recall, we selected six different goals that were going to be achieving this year. So today I want to talk through each of those and how we will work through those as well as how. You will engage with your teams on achieving and contributing to those goals. So the first one is service. So within our pathology and lab space for service, we selected that we would like to improve our patient engagement scores. So I'd like everyone to take a look at what those are for your areas and identify three key components for how we're going to improve those. The second would be in our employee engagement scores, so. For our team, that is really how I can engage with you and we'll be talking a little bit more about how we're going to do that. And I want you to be thinking through to how you can engage with your teams and look at your scores from last year, talk and meet with them and walk through what things they would like to improve as a team and that they can work towards. The third is quality. We selected several different items for that for this coming year and will be walking through each of those. Come to mind, the biggest one being turn around time, specially in pathology, for our PAP smears. That's one area we've identified as wanting to improve. Another is for our transplant patients, getting those results back more timely. In another area is our blood bank and how we can ensure that we are providing the right product in a timely fashion and meeting those goals we set forth. Financial goals, we have both revenue and supply expenses and being the major ones for this year. So we really need to think through what we're going to be doing with those. And what target numbers that we have especially for each of our different lab areas, we also have an expectation of growth. So as our system grows, we are also expected to increase our specimen production and keeping within those turn around time. So really thinking through what we need to be doing to both streamlined, but also do we need to relook at our staffing models, do we need to change some things, maybe yards are workflows and not just hiring additional. People and then innovation. So I know all of us have ideas. We really just pull those from our teams as we meet with those those people and move them forward. So think about those six pillars, the goals we've set forth, and next time we'll meet, we'll talk about strategy and get some ideas from all of you.",4.0
"My management philosophy is to truly develop leaders. I managed directors and they manage managers who manage teams. It's very important for me, for all of them to feel that they have my support but also my guidance. And so I will give feedback and that will be positive as well as things that people can work upon. My goal is to build a team, a culture of those that will delegate to one another, that will bring ideas forth. And even if we can't move forward on them, they feel comfortable that maybe we'll revisit it at another time or maybe it's just a week that. Doesn't work within our culture, our finances, etc. Let's think through maybe a different way of doing so. So teamwork, collaboration, and developing other leaders.",5.0
"I have been able to build a really good team around me of directors that help move things forward. Some have been in place since before I got here, and others leaders have switched over and I've been able to recruit and hire those that have a similar set of values that I have. Um. As well as those that have maybe similar values but different ways of approaching things, I think it's very important to have a team around you that will. Highlight certain aspects, but also, um, be those that have different skill sets, different backgrounds that bring a different type of way of looking at things. So I can honestly say that I have an amazing team. I would really like to recognize them for the work that they have done and how they have engaged their their own teams. I work within pathology and lab medicine and it is essential that we are constantly looking at ways to streamline processes, how we can make things better both for the workflow but also for our teammates and with the goal being our patient focus, we are essential to diagnostics to. Ways in which people are treated for their health issues and so if we are not working as an essential team, hand in hand with one another and don't feel comfortable bringing forth ideas or potential concerns. Um, we will really be in, uh, you know a place that. Is not good, so I reward and recognition is essential and I would really like to advocate for um. Doing some of that with my leaders.",

And I'll give you some examples of some things that I'm seeing and then we can maybe talk through it. I wanted to kind of hear your perspective, um, so the deliverables that we asked for, for the last two projects have been consistently late.

Any idea is more than welcome, any crazy idea is more than welcome. And then with that we give empowerment if you have an idea for something new for.

And that will be you and John, you'll take those items to do. And then Tracy and Jack and I will. Do the polar bear and all of the outside scenery. Hey, do we have any questions before we start?

"So I've heard from colleagues all around, you know, APEC, that they've been feeling burnt out recently and wish to have more paid time off from the company. So I've actually come up with three different points on, you know how else we can better this employee experience by giving them more time, more paid time off for holidays. The first one will be to increase employee retention. So paid time off is very, very valuable to every. Of the staff in the company and he could help you retain employees. So not only does it encourage people to, you know, have a better work life balance, but it also demonstrates how the companies, the company cares about its staff, its people. So this can instill loyalty and you know, boost retention. So secondly, it can actually give you access to better talent as well. So, you know, in many industries. Pete Time office is tender and company step down offered his benefit. Me lose out to attracting a better. Pool of talented people. So thirdly it will increase morale when employees don't have access to time Pete off their happiness, health, performance take a hit all which could you know make them feel banner and make them less motivated and successful at work. So offering pain more paid time off helps to ensure your employees come to work with a more positive and engaged um manner. So all of the above ties. To employee satisfaction we would reach in turn will lead to talent retention.",5.0
"So what we can do here is to, you know, do a test drive on a selected group of employee in various departments to try this out. We can give them additional paid time off, paid time off work and maybe after awhile we can measure their success by. Measure how how much these extra paid time off has improved their morale. So another way you can do is is true employee surveys to see how how happy they will be if the company offers them um. Additional peak time off work. So as an alternative to good remuneration package employees these days look for good work life balance which would then lead to the point on talent retention and also talent attraction.",5.0

"What is more difficult, from silver to one or from one to 10? This is a question. Kearney I already have a team with around five people, but I do want to grow my team to maybe 1020 or 50 people. So I do need a plan for my team to growth and how to allocate their job duties. So I feel plans for my team. First one is restructuring. Now we only have 5 people, so somebody have to do engineer plus research. Some people have to do count infrastructure with engineering plus research. So I feel this is a little bit messed up with their job duties. It's happened a lot in the startup stage, but now we are more sophisticated in the India team. So I think restructuring, it's the first part we need to take care of. So I'm planning to do most of the infrastructure. Job and let the scientists focus on the research. Job and engineered deliver what our research, what our model is to our customers and we need a QA team. We need some more engineer, we need some more depth of engineer in the future. So that must be involved. A lot of hiring and uh lots of communication. The second one is still knowledge sharing. Previously one of my college left our company and he asked a lot of questionable here living. About uhhh out infrastructure, how about some knowledge regarding the machine learning? That means we're not sharing enough information to him before. So that's the reason why I want to be more clear to share every information. What do you like to learn? What you like to know? Uh, with our college. So this is different plan? The same plan. Oh, the third one is I would like to host more face to face gathering. Now we're working from home. Obviously you can see my guitar so um think communication on some is OK, but with their face to face communication you can never know what their fair and you can never know their true respond. Because they can just AFK and they can turn off their video anytime. So I think face to face scattering is a must for my team. I will host more, maybe working with drinking, who knows?

Now, this is an engagement that will last approximately 3 weeks and for which we have a very detailed scope. Of work to conduct in that time frame. So in terms of my plan for the team, I want to start with the people that are involved. So again I am the manager but I have a support team both under me and above me. So starting with those that are working day today on the working team for me are two senior associates, one that is tenured senior associates so has some time in role and one that was newly promoted to that role I also have an associate on the team. Who has been enrolled for about a year. So three folks that you know will consider part of the working team along with myself as the manager. Now in terms of support levels above, we have both a Managing Director who is taking the lead in the client relationship and then of course the partner that initially sold the project to RP client. So we are the team again that will deliver this work at the end of three weeks and I am responsible for managing all of the day-to-day operations and ensuring we have a really strong deliverable at the end. So with this team of people, there are a set of systems that I will put in place to ensure we make appropriate progress along the three-week period. One of those systems is going to be a set of meetings at regular cadence is. To ensure that we are communicating and making the right progress along the way. Some of these meetings will consist of daily checkins and checkouts that are more process focused for me and the working team under me, the three folks I mentioned earlier, we will also have BI weekly meetings, meaning two meetings a week with the MD and the partner that are more story driven, meaning we're explaining our hypothesis. Explaining our key takeaways and learnings up until that point of the project and kind of bringing the details to a bit of a higher level to tell the overarching story for what we want to eventually tell the client. So in addition to daily process oriented meetings and biweekly content oriented meetings, I will set up workstream specific touchpoints so me as the manager will work with each of the three people. Under me one will be responsible for. The market section one will be responsible for everyones coming back. The competitor section and video, congratulations. I'd love to see. We ran out of time.",6.0
"My management philosophy consists of three main pillars. The first is to ensure that I am meeting everyone that I am managing at their level, whether they are inexperienced associate or a new senior associate, whatever. Their level is, both by title and by Capability, I want to ensure that I assess that and meet them at that level to begin our relationship. The second pillar is to communicate. Frequently and honestly, I love the term radical candor, and I really tried to communicate with my team members truthfully but also with empathy to make sure that the message is welcomed rather than, um, you know, accepted a bit defensively. The third pillar is not to micromanage, but to offer a lot of autonomy to team members that have demonstrated they can do good work.",6.0
"I wanted to give you a quick update on how the team is progressing on this project. So as you know, we have three folks on the working team in addition to myself, the first one team member, eh, you know, their newly promoted to the senior associate level. He has been fantastic. He's been working really autonomously, problem solving sufficiently and kind of driving his section to a really good place I haven't had to. Micro manage his work and he's really doing a wonderful job on this engagement so far. Team Member B is an experienced senior associate, but I'm having a little bit of trouble with him. It seems like his morale is a bit low these past couple of weeks his work ethic has suffered and I've noticed a lot of careless mistakes on his slides and also less engagement in team meetings. So I'd love to get your advice and perspective on how I can. Potentially turn things around with him. I'm planning to have a midpoint feedback conversation in the next couple of days and would love to incorporate any thoughts you have into that discussion I'll have with him. Team members see as you know is a new associate, very green. She is very enthusiastic, has been studying up on this topic and really contributing in team meetings even though she again is newer and doesn't yet have the foundation or business acumen. Demonstrated. I'm going to keep an eye out for how her thought process develops. I think she'll need more reps, honestly, to really get the handle of how we're operating in deal strategy. But I think the attitude has been great and she's really jumping in to see a lot of the tasks through to completion.",
"My boss is a partner at Deal strategy and he is responsible for a few different things. The first is selling work to clients so that we can generate revenue as a practice. Now this work typically consists of projects that are either commercial due diligence is or growth strategy engagements for private equity clients or potentially in some cases corporate clients. Again, the selling of projects is critical for generating revenue for the practice and for ensuring that the staff has worked to conduct throughout the year. Now in addition to selling, there is meeting with clients and generating relationships that can potentially lead to sales in the future, so filling the pipeline with potential clients and potential projects and then of course they have to oversee current engagements and keep team and practice morale. App.",
"Hi, I wanted to have this one-on-one to discuss what I've been seeing over the past couple of months. Um, it seems as though your work has been slipping compared to before, and I think this is in the form of your kind of attitude towards the work, but also the deliverables themselves. I've noticed things come to me too late or come to the client too late and I just want to dig into why this might be happening and first of all I want to. You know from your perspective what has been going on? Is there anything I should know about that has been causing your performance to slip? Um, just want to give you the chance to let me know what what's going on. So in terms of your morale, I understand that, you know, you're feeling burned out and you know, you've been kind of on back-to-back difficult projects and I definitely understand that. So one thing I can do to try to help is ensure that with staffing we get you on something a bit lighter for the next round. But I really want you to commit to finishing this engagement as well as you can. I think that's good for your development, but also for the teams. Output so again will work on the burnout on the next project and I just want you to work with me here on this current engagement. In terms of the late deliverables, why don't we communicate more frequently? I would love for you to give me a couple checkins a day, so in the morning and in the evening, aside from our regularly scheduled meetings, I'd love a quick e-mail. Just spend 5 or 10 minutes outlining your plan for the day that asks you want to accomplish. And any roadblocks that you're experiencing that I can help you with? I think this will help get us back on track with our deliverables timing.",4.0
"Alright, team, we have to work fast. Here's our plan to complete this puzzle before all of the other teams. First, all four of us are going to separate the puzzle pieces by color. So the polar bear is likely going to be white and the tiger is likely going to be orange and black. So as quickly as possible, we need to separate the colors and the puzzle pieces into separate piles. As soon as we do that, we're going to have two of us make the polar bear. So we're taking the white puzzle pieces and putting them together as quickly as. Possible, while the other two are going to do the same with the tiger, with the orange and the black pieces. Now one of these groups might be done first, at which point you will assist the other pair with their animal. So as a team we can be very efficient by first separating colors and then by working in pairs on the polar bear and on the tiger, and then supporting the team that needs a little bit more help.",6.0
"My plan as a creative directors part in part of the design team. My plan as a manager is first and foremost to inspire. I want my team to feel inspired and it comes from um. It comes from maturing and environment that is highly creative and also fighting and advocating for them to get projects that they feel passionate about. It's important that they can as they feel fulfilled and excited. Dole travel lots. Um, a lot more. Also provide them a lot of sources of inspiration and really encouraged him to get out of there. Traditional source of inspiration to really enrich the things like their visual references that they have.

As you know as they grow they will be able to also take on younger designers and help them you know also develop their design skills. So it's important that the. Develop, um, angry. I pushed them to develop a really keen, sharp eye for detail, typography skills and you know. Let them in into the my process and my experience so that they can they can develop their own. Then the last thing would be to navigate their work environment. For me, it's really important to um. Uh, to help them understand that corporate environment is a little different from a design studio, and often it's something that they can struggle with. Um, it's a lot of different dynamics and politics. Office expectations are also very different. So it's really. Something with my team that I'm actively working on, so I'm always make sure that I'm always available for them.

"For someone who? Um. Would not be doing well. Um, I would usually use to dumb down. I usually have one on ones with my direct reports on a weekly basis. So we would just have you know, a regular touch base where I could ask them if they're feeling OK, if everything's alright, if they want to talk about anything. Usually I can get a sense if something has been feeling off, um, trying to prevent that with weekly touch bases and just, you know, constant communication. With emm um. Usually they'll open or benwolf find out that there's something personal happening most of the time that will be impacting their performance and also their focus at work. Um. That way, you know, it becomes more of something we can work on together and I can coach them through the personal stuff rather than. In managing dream motions, or in just like, you know, giving them the room to get better so that they can come back feeling more relaxed, it's often. Something that can be fixed.

This includes managing their websites, social media. Accounts and other technology infrastructure. I will need to figure out how to manage all of these new assets and delegate some of the responsibilities to members of our team. This will also include analyzing and auditing these systems that are currently in use and seeing if there is some streamlining that we can do to make the work more manageable. At the same time, we will still have to continue our current work with our current. Organization, including some of our techniques internally and maintaining our support staff to support our customers. My my goal is to delegate more responsibilities to the team and have them function autonomously in their work unless there is a major issue or crisis. My goal is to coach them to.

You'll have to make sure that you answer these messages on time, because it's not acceptable to leave that customers hanging like that. They expect an answer in a reasonable amount of time. In fact, our guidelines include that. You know messages have to be answered by the end of your shift and if those go unanswered that is not acceptable. I also want you to answer messages on Slack in a timely manner, so. This is your first warning that you need to do these things, or else will have to. Kind of.

"So on this project were faced with a particular set of circumstances, it's going to be a very demanding client in the very demanding timeline. And so I want to be really cognizant in the situation that we are staffing both in accordance to peoples priorities and development goals as well as to their existing abilities. I think there are projects that are great step up opportunities and then there are projects that are really great. To show off what you're already really strong, yet to me this seems like this project is going to be more of, eh, let's get you into a role where you can pressure test how strong and how accomplished you are in things that you have experienced doing versus thrusting you into a brand new role in a project that's going to already be demanding. So my recommendation in terms of team rules here is that we slot whoever has experience with the market model. On the market model, um Workstream and that we slot whoever has experience with the survey on the survey work stream, but also make a note of that going forward so that those team members, if that's not in line with their development and priorities, have a chance to experience uhhh wrapped in in those areas on their next project. I think it's really important that we say that now since it won't be something that we can accomplish in this immediate project. So want to make sure that we're dedicated to doing that in the future. Thank you.",
"So my boss has, I would say two sort of fundamental rules. When is the tactical bring in new clients, protecting teams, um, an actual projects and fielding tough questions that sort of the technical job description. But I think that the role expands much further and is, um, fostering inclusivity and connectivity among team members, particularly in remote environments? Um, it's focused on retention and recruitment of new team members. Building the team and it's really focused on culture as well. That is a really important part of my bosses role outside of the technical job description of bringing in new clients. I think they play a really important part in building that team environment that is so fundamental to the success of our job. Thank you.",
"Hi, person. Thank you so much for taking some time to speak today. I know we hadn't scheduled this, but I didn't really want to get this time on your calendar proactively. I think there's something that we should talk about and I wanted to check in. I've noticed over the past couple weeks that you've missed a couple deadlines. You know, on Tuesday I was expecting X deliverable, didn't get it until Thursday and. You know, I, I just first of all want to understand, you know, are there circumstances that it should be made aware of? Is there anything that's going on that we can talk about or that I can help your dress or where you need more support that that's the first area I want to talk about. Um and an area #2 would be how we can go forward and sort of remedy some of these areas where they've been gaps recently and I think, you know, there's some tactical tips. I'd love to share if you're open to them. Um, but I think it's really important that we have this conversation now rather than later and that we address these recent gaps that have developed. So I want to hear from you. You know, first of all, is there anything that I can do to support you right now? And then let's get into that conversation about what I need to be seeing in the next few weeks in terms of running some of those recent gaps. Thank you.",4.0

One person should sort the tiger pieces into a little orange pile, and one person should sort the corner pieces because they'll be really important to get the edges, um, right as soon as possible. That would be really helpful in terms of building out the rest of the puzzle. Um, anyone have any preferences here? Now, OK, in that case, I suggest that Alex, you get on the polar bears. Christy, you get on the tiger pieces and share. Eh? You get on the edges. Um, person #4 let's you and I sort of, like, strategize and fill in the gaps as much as possible. OK, awesome. Let's do this.

"There are several components to my plan for my team. Um, these breakdown into several categories. The first of these is #1 how to deliver a good experience for the people I'm working with. That, to me means first their development and their priorities and goals are accounted for, understood and measured throughout the course of the project #2 I want my team members to feel cared for. Beyond the scope of the project, and they're not just employees, but they're also humans beyond the project and I want to get to know them and show them that I care. 3rd I want them to feel coached and supported when that's what they need, but also given autonomy and trust to execute on their own and and feel like the, ER, trusted. Um, so that that is how I envision delivering a good experience for my team. The second component is being results oriented. That to me means first clear alignment on goals. From the get go second buy in from senior leadership um, and that means that I'm getting the support that I need. Front from leadership to make sure that I can in turn support team members I work with. 3rd consistent checkins to ensure that we are in lock step not just at the beginning of the project, but throughout the course of the execution.

"My management philosophy is centered around the people that I work with. It's really important to me to understand their goals, their priorities, and who they are outside of projects that we might work on together.

Um, that is really what's important to me in managing is that philosophy of making sure that the 1980s feel cared for and supported throughout the course of the project.",5.0

"Hi. So the question is how did I end up in the career role I'm in today? I would say there are three stages um to where I am right now. The first stage was myself getting into it and that started with my choosing the engineering field and I would say that was kind of um. And result of the fact that I was in India, born in India and it happens to be putting a lot of focus on engineering and medical and I was not into bio biology at all. So I chose engineering and I ended up in the field. The second stage was when I moved from. Development or coding to business side and I did about 10 years of coding and moved to the lead role. I was managing A-Team, but I was always interested in the user perspective on the business side of things. It just so happened that I started in that area and all my movements were going in that area, but I was always trying to understand the business side and one. We moved to USI, joined um one firmware. I was hired as a development, but the project and it ended up being that there was no coding work and I jumped right into doing all the analysis and contributing to that. And that's how I started getting into the business side of things. And the third stage was when I jumped from being a business analyst to a product manager and that was all because of my. Push and preparation and going to the next level in that business area and that's my current role, a product manager. Thank you.",4.0
"Hi. Today I'm going to teach you how to play empire. Empire is our favorite cream that we play with our family, friends and the kids, and we are about 10 of us and it's a perfect game for this number of people. About 8 to 10. Too much is going to be hard to handle and two less it's not going to be fun. So how you start is that everybody right? You pick a category and then everybody writes what they can think of in that category, for example. It could be fast food chains and everybody will write, say, McDonald's, Taco Bell or anything else, and you can get as much creative in the category as you start playing more and more of this game. Some of the things that we've paid with is adjectives, body parts, countries. Of course, a simple then you can combine categories, adjective and food, objective and country and it becomes very fun. So. Once you have all the categories put in, everybody has written them on a node. One person reads them all, reads all the categories, and everybody remembers what was read out. And then you go in a round Robin. Each person will try to guess who wrote what was on. The nodes, and if you guess it right, that person becomes part of your team and then you get another chance to guess another person what they wrote. And if you get it right, get it right, they become part of your team and it goes on. The goal of the game is to increase your empire. That's your team. So if the last person who remains unguessed and has everybody else guest as part of their team, that person wins. I hope you enjoy. I'm sure you will enjoy if you play with your friends.",4.0

"I work for BNY Mellon in their Pennington office, and one thing I really like about the workplace is that there's always something to learn. And there are opportunities to. Put yourself in places where you can learn more and challenge yourself. The other thing I like is that there is a culture of collaboration. People are always ready to help each other and there is a personal collection that we tend to make with the team that we work with. The one thing that I would like to change is that we need to have little less meetings, especially not in the lunch time, so that we can have some personal relationships developed with our team. We can go out for lunch is. And that we used to do celebrate birthdays of our team members, which is no longer possible with all the meetings.",5.0

And I-10, four, I believe, were year. Then I got hired full time, actually went through a series or managers. But my last match before I became manager, the group actually was one of my best mentors. He saw something in me. He saw something that he felt he could cultivate. Um. He saw the eagerness of me to do more and be more. Um. So he slowly started giving me projects to see how I would do with them. And he's so I kind of took them. And he kind of saw, even though I was relatively, you know, um, not senior intergroup. Um.

"My favorite sport to play basketball. It's been a passion of mine since I was a little kid. I think. Probably the thing I love most about the game is a game you can play by yourself with your friends. You know, one on 1/2 on two or three on 3/4 four and five on five. And literally all you need is a basketball and a hoop. And it's, you know, they and me being born and raised in New York City. You could find a basketball hoop mostly every neighborhood. So it's a game that was easily accessible well before school, after school, during lunch time, my friends, we would overpay basketball. It's a very simple game. It's a game where you have a ball in. The goal was to get into hoop. Um, get the ball in the hoop. It's worth 2 points. If you're behind a certain line, which we call the deep online, and you make a shot, it's worth, it's worth. It's a deep online, so it's worth 3 points. Um. I think the biggest rule is you got constantly have to keep dribbling the ball. If you pick up the ball, you can't take more than two steps without dribbling the ball. But once you pick it up, you can't go back to drilling, which we call the travel. So the rules are very simple. You have to maintain the dribble ball, which consists of this bouncing ball up and down. If you pick up the ball, you can't take more than two steps before you take a shot. And. I will play Street Ball, so it's called your own files. Um with someone? Um. Purposely pushes you or bumps into you while you're dribbling the ball. While you're shooting, you could call file, which you get to start to play again, check the ball out and run to play over again. If we're playing streetball, we don't play with feet those. We are playing with feet those. Then you get to shoot one free shot at the free throw line, which is worth one point. Um, once again, it's it's basketball. Very simple sport, but it's very active. You get to run up and down and. Play you go out there, shoot by yourself, enjoy yourself. Will pay with a bunch of friends.",6.0

"Hi team and welcome to Project Apollo. I just want to start by thanking you for joining the team. It should be pretty exciting project. The project is for Pizza Hut is owned by Yum Brands and it's one of their kind of staple QSR restaurants or quick service restaurants. The project will be made-up of two parts. The first part is a commercial due diligence which we're going to look through the kind of overall market competitive landscape. And customer opinions in the second part is a growth strategy piece for them, which is going to look at #1 potential acquisitions that Pizza Hut may look to add to their portfolio. And two, looking at new locations where they may look to expand. So starting with the commercial diligence piece that's going to be led by error. And for this piece, we're going to be looking at the market to start off with and when I say market, we're going to be looking at. The underlying growth trends in Peter sales and how that's moved from today 2022 to what it looks like in 2027. The second piece will look at is the competitive landscape. And we're going to look at Pizza Hut compared to its main competitors, so the likes of other independent pizza restaurants and Domino's. And then we're also going to look at them in relation to their other competitive fast food trends. So burgers. Like McDonald's, you know, local Chinese, Japanese restaurants. The next part we're going to be looking at is the consumer preferences and we're going to conduct a survey for this and try and get around 1000 responses. And as a result their responses were going to help number one understand who the kind of key customers are and what their kind of customer archetype is as well as pushing forward on.

"While sales management has probably changed a little bit from when I was first manager, but I feel now that a strong manager kind of provides clear direction up front, but then allows the team members to work independently. So for this kind of project and for the way I want to lead the team at the front or at the start, I want to provide guidance about, you know, what I expect, what I think the project should look like and where we should be. Where we should be moving towards. However, I really like to manage teams in a way that gives them the flexibility to work independently and to take ownership over their own sections and reach out to me, you know, when they need additional guidance. So overall, I'm available at all times and willing to give guidance wherever needed, but want you to work as independently as possible.",5.0
"Hey, Michelle, just wanted to quickly touch base with you about the team structure of for the upcoming project Apollo. Um. So as you know, we've got a pretty small team. It's just going to be yourself leading engagement, myself as the manager and then with Oliver and Page, um, overall, I think the projects can run pretty smoothly in terms of the delegation of tasks. I think I'm going to give Oliver the market section he's super strong with. Market modeling has done a single project with me before and I feel comfortable he's gonna be able to knock this print out of the park. On the competitive section, we've got page, this is going to be cages first time leading a section, but I don't really have any hesitation to that. Her being able to run this comfortably, I'll be there as a position of support, but ultimately she assisted on competitive section before and I've seen her run customer sections on other projects. So I feel like it's going to be pretty. Smoothly run for me. I'm just gonna act as the you know, the originate arrive ideas set the storyboard upfront and then be a back board for them to bounce things off um throughout the project in terms of what I kind of want from you. Um you know depending on you know your level of availability would just be to you know maybe a weekly check in to be able to run ideas and initial drafts by you and then crucially getting your. Inputs over the exact sum and any kind of client interaction information don't need to know. Sounds good.",
"In my business, my boss is essentially the engagement partner, and this case I'll speak about Zach, who is kind of my lead partner, um, as he specializes in the retail and consumer space. His role has a few facets, but I think the primary one, you know his day today is around selling, selling projects. So that means reaching out to private equity and corporates, understanding what their, what their needs are, what they're interested in and and developing potential opportunities and then looking to sell them commercial due diligence or growth strategies. The second major part of this job is project execution. And in that position, he's more, eh, guiding figure and, you know, ultimately responsible for the way that the workers, you know. Given to the client, but it needs a level of oversight to the work that our team, the manager and the and the juniors are doing and that is involved with the storyboarding, the messaging, and then the overall look and feel for what the project looks like.",
"Hey, listen, thank you for joining the meeting with me today. So this is just going to be some kind of feedback over the last two projects where we've worked together. So firstly, probably just like to ask you, you know how you think the projects on what you've done well, what you think you improved on? OK, great that, you know, I kind of agree with some of those things and disagree. Um, from my perspective, I think some of the quality of the deliverables has been lacking a little bit and we can go into kind of some of the, you know, bigger specifics around there. But if we kind of flip through the deck like this slide here, I saw your original draft and you can see that I put in a significant amount of work to alter that. So what you could do better is cleaning up the formatting, putting more insightful messaging on the side and having A tag. That really pulse. Um. Secondly, in terms of the timelines. So I think you've been, um, it's been a little bit slow. So, you know, I appreciate that we're working, you know, working hard and there's some pretty tight levels. But you know, when when we commit to giving the client something on the Friday, we really need to work backwards from that. And so, you know, it's ready Wednesday night. So I can review Thursday, make changes and then give to the partner for Friday. And if that schedule isn't working, they're just going to be kind of problems up the stream, so. The way to manage that is to tell me what you think you can get done and then we can work together and figure out how we can, you know, progress the back to where it needs to be. Um, finally, it's probably just a little bit of a qualitative thing. So I don't think your attitudes being super great. You're being kind of logging off early. You know, you haven't been contributing team meetings and I think this may be having a bit of a detrimental impact on the team. So this one is kind of more difficult to kind of have a. Single solution, but I just appreciate if you could, you know, bring a bit more, you know, pragmatism and you know, um positively to these meetings and at least contribute so we know that you're feeling a part of the team. Me know if you disagree with any of those items.",5.0
"Alright team, this is a bit of a fun one. We've got 100 piece jigsaw puzzle or a team before. We're competing against other teams and I want to win this. So what I suggest is you know. At the start, we're all working together and we are sitting through 25 pitches, 25 pieces each, and we're putting any edge pieces to one side, so that should take all of, you know, 20 seconds to separate all the edge pieces from there. One person will start working along the edges and trying to map out, you know, the kind of perimeter of the thing. The other three people on the team. So myself, Lindsay and and rob, what we're gonna do is start separating the colors. So fortunately we know that the tiger is going to be, you know, oranges and blacks and we know the polar bear is gonna be why it's so then we can separate those two colors and that should give us 3 distinct parts, the perimeter, the tiger and the pole there. From there we can start individually working. On each of the animals and bring it all together and we should be able to wrap this up pretty quickly.",6.0
"With regards to a plan for my team, I think my biggest priority is that my team is happy. I know that may be a little bit strange. Other managers may focus on success or KP eyes or efficiency, but I really do just want whatever my plan ends up being for my team to feel happy. This does actually result in them also feeling successful. I want them to feel confident in the work they're doing. I want them to feel satisfied and fulfilled, and I want them to be able to do the things that they actually want to do on a daily basis. I think there are a few key steps involved here, #1 being really, really high levels of communication. And so as a plan. As a manager for my team, I want my teammates to feel like they can communicate with each other seamlessly and communicate with me very transparently about the work they're doing and how they're feeling doing that work. I think #2 is a facilitation of how they actually work together and collaborate. My organization is fully remote. That poses some challenges while also giving some great benefits for my teammates to feel happy. With their work, they should be able to collaborate together despite these remote challenges and feel like they can be a team and actually enjoy each others company and sort of get along while meeting goals and doing things together. I think the third piece is really just understanding what they want to do, what they like to do and what they're good at. And so in my plan that third step may actually be the most important where it requires that I analyze the workload that we have as a team and delegate it efficiently. And optimally. To the members of my team, based on what their strengths are, their weaknesses, are there opportunities for growth, what they're interested in, where they want to go in the future, where they can grow and make sure that they have opportunities to cross? Collaborate with teammates on my team and teammates from other teams to grow in those skills, or even mentor other people in those skills that again, they like, they enjoy their good at, or they want to become good at. Of course there going to be times where that's not entirely possible and so. Going back to that second point, just around communication, making sure that my teammates feel comfortable advocating for themselves, advocating for each other when communicating with me really transparently so that I understand, OK, this may not have been the best thing for you. It was necessary. We got it done. We move beyond it, and they still feel happy because they know that there are better things on the horizon with our team.",7.0
"My philosophy as a manager, like much like my plan for my team as a manager, revolves around how my teammates feel. I want them to feel happy. I want them to feel satisfied, fulfilled by their work. I want them to feel successful. I want to, I want them to feel like they're making great contributions to the organization, and I want all of these things to be bits and pieces of what they're doing every single day. And so instead of really focusing on what kinds of things I can do as a manager to force these things to happen, my philosophy would more so be how can I be a person? Or my teammates feel like they can communicate with me to just let me know what I can do to support them. What are some other things that I can go out of my way to do to make them feel heard or make them feel like I'm their advocate? So things like micromanagement wouldn't be something I would want to do, right? If I want my teammates to feel successful and feel confident, I don't want them to feel like they're burdened by the work or burdened by me sort of staring down their shoulders.",5.0

But overall, I think they did a phenomenal job, Tyler, especially managing our entire schedule, managing all 60 councillors, kind of getting where they need to be, keeping our products running or programs running throughout the summer, making sure that we get Subs and we need them. I mean, really just above and beyond in terms of communication with our counselors. Make sure that they feel, feel heard and feel like things that came up for them over the summer are being listened to and really, really doing a great job communicating with me just to make sure that I'm in the loop, communicating with Alexis R, Counselor, manager to make sure she's in the loop and just keeping things running. Alexis as well, I think did a really great job. We had a few performance blips for our counselors over the summer that she did a great job sort of coaching them out of and helping them sail through those sort of stormy season, our busy season. Parents can get kind of crazy, kids can get kind of crazy, but. I think she did a great job supporting our counselors and the numbers, numbers speak for themselves in terms of how many kids we serve this summer, how satisfied they were, how many kids are coming back for the fall already for the academic year coming out of our programs in the summer. And so I think our team has been doing a really, really great job. Definitely some creases, some growth opportunities that we can iron out and justice get in place for next summer. But overall, really, really solid job.",

He supports any sort of larger HR level decisions or HR level issues that may arise and then on the ad hoc side he supports our product development with.

"Hey, Tyler. Yeah, thanks for, thanks for making the time to meet. This isn't going to be the easiest conversation, but I do just want to make sure that, you know up front. The goal for this conversation is for us to just get back on track as a team. I've noticed that over the past couple of months you've been just struggling a little bit. Some of the deliverables that you had assigned have come in late. You've seemed maybe a little bit on edge or just a little more unhappy than usual, and I just really want to check in on that. And some of the things that are happening are just making it difficult for our team and other teams like victors team, you know the support team, some of our counselors to also feel successful and and they're just also concern. And so they were just encouraging me and encouraging us to have this check in, have a little conversation just around what might be going on. And so again, the goal for this conversation is just to get us back on track. The first step for that really, I just want to hear from you, I want to hear from you what might be going on, if there's anything going on at work or outside of work that. Might be impacting your. Our ability to to complete work in a timely manner or just impacting your life in general. I want to hear about it. It's not things you want to talk about that's that's also totally fine. But I do just need to know from you if there's anything going on that I can support with. Otherwise, you know, towards the end of this call, I do want to sort of set a plan for ourselves, for me and you, an accountability plan for how we're going to take some steps forward. And so just identifying places where I can support you, you can support yourself, you may want support from. Other folks on our team, maybe Alexis can chip in or some of the Councils can chip in and just identify some timelines or we can see some improvement. But First things first, I just want to hear from you. This is a check in first and foremost. Just on what's going on, if there's anything I can do to help with anything any of us can do to help or if there's any sort of justice context do you want to give? Let's hear from you first. I just want to check in.",4.0
"Alright, hundred piece puzzle. That means we're moving quickly. We need four people split up into four different tasks. Alexis, I want you on sorting. That means you're sorting all of the pieces into edge, white and brown. Edge obvious. White being polar bear, brown being the brown bear. Tyler, you're going to be working on the edge. Alexis, you're going to join in afterwards. So Alexis on sorting Tyler on edge. Alexis will join Edge after all the pieces are sorted. Don, you're working on the polar bear and I will work on the brown bear as pieces come your way. Try and self sort again into things that would match. So we're working on edge white edges, brown edges, green edges for the foliage, ground, black, white, anything like that. And as you finish up your sections, keep scanning other people sections to see if there's a connection. So again, one more time. Alexis, you're doing some quick sorting. Tyler, you're working on the edge to start. Don, you're working on the polar bear white pieces and I will work on the brown bear. Alexis, when you're done sorting, you're jumping in on edge as well.

He's a senior associate. He's been here for about 2 years. He's really strong in modeling, but he's been doing models back-to-back. So I think that I prefer him to not be on the model workstream just because I'm worried he's getting a little bit burned out. I'm going to have him on the competitor Workstream. He's going to be paired with Jill, who's a new joiner associate. She just joined our team a few weeks ago and could really use some help getting up to speed quickly. I think pairing Jack and Jill together is going to set them up for success. Next on the team, we have Dave. Dave is an experienced associate. He's been on the team here for about a year and a half. He's done one or two models, but it's still not his strong suit. I'd like to have him on the model workstream and that way I can help facilitate him learning that and get him a bit stronger in that space, especially as he's looking to make the move to senior associate. And that model skill set is going to be really important for that next promotion move. And then finally we have Steve. Steve? Is an associate that's been here for about six months. He's quite strong even though he's only been here for six months and so I'd like him running the expert interview campaign. He'll also be working on the customer workstream. It's a little bit of an easier work stream, so I think this will be good for him to kind of flex his skills, own something while also having a bit of an easier time compared to some of the other tougher workstreams. We were really great team and I think this is going to be an awesome project. Appreciate you helping me pull together this, this great team and looking forward to working with everybody on it.",
"Jack's role in the company is really twofold. First and foremost, he is client facing, so he is helping to build business for our practice by connecting with clients, understanding what they're looking for and then making sure that we can have a service that meets that need. So he is selling work for us to then work on. Secondly, he's a subject matter expert, so he knows the space inside and out, he knows the trends. He's worked in this field for 20 years. So he really, really understands us in a deep and intuitive way. And so he provides a lot of context for us as we're thinking about what the projects look like, what some of our initial hypothesis are. And he's a really good sounding board and thought partner as we're working through any of the problems that come up on our projects. So he first cells work. For us. And then he also helps to make sure that we're delivering really high content and really high quality work.",
"Hi, Jill. Thanks so much for taking the time to speak with me in chat with me today. Um, I wanted to understand if you're doing OK, if there's anything going on. I've noticed over the past few months that the quality of your work has slipped a little bit and just wondering if there's something going on at home or, you know, if you're not feeling well. Just want to get a better understanding of what's happening. I also want to take the opportunity to remind you that there is a lot of firm services available if you do need to take some time away, um, you. We have unlimited sick days. So if you're not feeling well, please feel free to take advantage of those. I want you to be healthy and happy. And that's really the first and foremost, most important thing, work, um, second to any of that. So just want to remind you of what those opportunities are that we have here and those benefits that are available to you. If it's not something that is going on at home or if you're you know it's not something that you're not feeling well, I do want to talk to you a little bit about your attitude. I've noticed you've been a little frustrated with some of our other team members and wanted to get a better understanding of what was happening there. Is there something that went on behind the scenes? Um, something that I'm not aware of? It would just be helpful for me so I can make sure that we're keeping morale really high. I know it can be really stressful at times on this in this job, but it is important for me to. Now, what's going on in the background? Great. Well, thanks so much for resolving this with me.",9.0
"Hi, team. We're going to have to go ahead and put together a puzzle really quickly. We're competing against ten other teams, and so we have to think about how we can be most efficient. I think the best plan of attack is to be splitting us up into different roles. So Steve, I'm going to have you focused on the edges of the puzzle. You're going to grab any of the edge pieces and start building the edges. Jack, I'm going to have you focused on sorting the puzzle pieces. So the polar bear pieces are typically going to be white or grey if you can put all of those in a pile, and then the tiger pieces, that are going to be all. Orange, if you can put those in a pile. And then, Jill, I'm going to have you start putting together the polar bear. And so you'll grab all those white pieces and start putting together the puzzle and that will fit into the broader, broader edge pieces. And then I'm going to have Dave focused on putting together the tiger, and that's all hopefully fit into the other part of the edge pieces and make the full puzzle. Does anybody have any questions on that? Do you think there's a better strategy we should employ? Or does that all work for you? We think that makes sense. Awesome. Alright, well let's do her best and hopefully we can win or be pretty close to the top. Let's go guys.",6.0
"Alright, everybody, who wants to win the puzzle? Putting together competition. Here's what I think we should do. Um, let's have one person work on turning all the pieces over so that the right side up and not on top of each other. Somebody else should take the edges and somebody else should take the inside. And I think two other people should take the inside pieces. Let's get started on this. And if you are working on an inside piece and you notice that it should be in the edge pool, make sure you that you move your piece over to the edge. Kyle and and we can get going from there and, um, let's just divide and conquer conquer and see if we can beat these other teams at their own game. Thanks. Bye.",4.0
"Hi Jeff, I wanted to take a few minutes and talk to you about your performance over the last couple of months in the taxonomy team. Um, and I just wanted to get your thoughts on it as well as communicate some of the things that I've been seeing. One of the things I've noticed is that you've taken on some stories that you have not been able to complete on time on on time as you as planned by the Sprint and the quality of the work. That's coming through for the deliverables isn't meeting the expectations for the teams. This is really having an impact not only on your personal performance, but on the performance of the team as a whole and. My expectation is, is if there's any deliverables that you're not going to be able to deliver on time or that you're not able to meet the quality of the other team mates on time, that you would pull me aside and we can have a discussion on what the what your individual challenges are and how I consult help support you in order to be a team player on the taxonomy team. This is really something that I'm hoping that we can work together on and make a few adjustments so that we can incrementally deliver on our commitments. So the first thing that I wanted to talk to you about is why you think that we're having some issues with your performance as of late and what you would like to do in order to move back into a more performant role.",3.0
"My boss is the chief architect for Silicon Valley Bank. As the chief architect, it's your job to set the technical direction for all IT deliverables coming out of the bank. And that's really something where you're defining the enterprise architecture, you're sending the solutions architecture. You're also very involved in cyber data and application architecture as well. So there's two main components to the chief. Architects Rule one is to set the technology direction, understand where the industry is going, understand what applications we have on our portfolio and ensure we are building both the functional and nonfunctional requirements of our product owners. And the 2nd component of it is really governed the technical direction and that is to ensure as things are being built out across the the company that they're building in alignment with the direction that that's being set.",
"Our teams building the enterprise taxonomy for the firm, and this is a really challenging opportunity, but additionally, it's so needed. At USVI Bay, our team is a team of taxonomy architects that build out the entire enterprise taxonomy. Um. And they partner with individuals on the architecture space, in the data space and in the product space. They define the core capabilities across the entire. Organization and put that taxonomy in place so that we can in the future organize ourselves, our IT components and our data deliverables across that architecture context. That'll give real business capability view of how we're delivering our products across the entire organization. Our team is great group of taxonomy architects and they have to have a very specific skill set. They have to be. Um, technical enough to work with the domain architects and understand the technical components that we're delivering as an organization. But they also have to have the business savvy to be able to face off with some of the product owners, sometimes very senior heads of organizations throughout the entire company to explain what we're doing from a taxonomy perspective and to make sure that they give. The value add or and the So what to what we're doing so that they will employ the correct people to help partner with us. It's a very interesting, fun and innovative space and we've got a great team.",
"There's a few tenants that I'd like to bring forth with my management philosophy and it's really around how I like myself to be managed. I believe in being hands off unless my employees need me, and then I'm become more and more hands on as they need me. I always try to give them opportunities to stretch and grow, grow as an individual. So I try to think about how I can put them into opportunities, new opportunities to, um, stretch as as a person. And to achieve their own individual goals. And finally, I always like to have a plan. So really, what is my strategic plan on what I need to achieve? But don't let that strategic Plan B the thing to keep you from achieving your goals. In other words, be willing to break that strategic plan in order to deliver on my objectives.",3.0
"Team, we've spent the first half of the year building our enterprise domain taxonomy. So now is where the fun begins, right where get to make sure that we can mentor all of the domain architects so that they can take what we've created forward and apply it across all the sets of IT components, across the entire IT landscape at SV Bay. So how are we going to do that? It's going to require. A great deal of a mentor ship in training, so we first need to ensure that the domain architects understand how to create a target state road map across their portfolio of applications and how to build a data product that's aligned to the taxonomy. This is going to require us to both do sets of training sessions in ordered one-on-one, lightning talks, and actually white. Boarding solutions and to show them exactly what good looks like to put together a correct reference architecture that they can take forward and apply across their particular domain in loans, payments, etc etc. And then the other big thing that we're going to have to do for the second-half of the year is really communicate and really put go on some Rd shows where we actually show the value of what the taxonomy is. Giving to the organization as a whole so we can take a couple of very specific use cases and show how it applied taxonomy is driving uh solutions within the organization. Whether it's working with Sundeep Steam on the data space, whether it's partnering with Nanda and his group of API Architects in the API space, or whether it's actually working with Gagan in the prior product organization for the product space. And we could show these value add activities across numerous sets of dashboards and across numerous sets of training materials on how we are able to communicate our enterprise landscape and how we can leverage that enterprise landscape to show how we're going to move toward target state in certain particular business areas or functions. This is very new to the organization, this really exciting way of showcasing and. Reporting that we are aligned to the product organizations. So it requires like a very different mindset shift, as you know. And we're going to have to bring other teams and organizations along in helping to apply our approach so that we can pass this off to the domain architects and then we can move on and do other fun stuff. Thanks.",3.0
"Awesome. So we did a lot of great work last week and we are almost at the home stretch. We've gotta re out on Thursday and I think we have three things that we need to cover. The first is that we need to update our survey. We got a lot of new survey responses last week and I want to do 2 things with them. First, I want to update. I want to check to make sure that all the survey and is correct, that these are real responses. And 2nd, I want to go and update every single one of our survey response or every single one of our survey slides in order to make sure that we are getting exactly what we need. So Jeff and Camille, if you two could please do that today that seems like it would be. Incredibly helpful. I think that probably takes, you know, a good six hours to get everything done and then once the slides are updated, the three of us can loop back together and we can think through whether or not any of our story has substantively changed based on those pages. 2nd. There are a couple of net new pages that I think we're going to need to cover things like what is this, the decision processes that are trying to be made work he trends in the market, how do some of the competitors vary by customer type, other things like that, Alex, I believe we have all the information for this in our expert interviews and in the survey and I can send you some templates after this call for some of those pages, so. As of now, it would be great if you could lean in and get those in. I think right now we just try to think through the answer because I've got some templates on the pages and we can get that done in a couple hours, so that shouldn't be too much of a problem in 3rd and I think this is the largest lift. We want to do some analysis on how. Likely this company is to win and actually grow at the clients 25% market share that we want them to do so for so many. I would love it if you could dig through sort of our market model and survey data and be able to outlines, hey, here's what we know, right? We know that prices are going to grow at X, we know that. That Y percent of these customers are going to move to cloud. We know from our survey that Z percent are trying to churn. And we can build that up in a spreadsheet model out, OK, here's what we actually think their total revenue is going to be. Outside of getting new logos and then here's the number of new logos they would need to win and what you would need to believe about that, which I think would be really helpful. I think this is going to be relatively heavy lift, so why don't you get started in two hours, let's touch base and we can figure out exactly what we need to do. I think if we do, those three things will be in great shape for readout on Thursday.",5.0
"I'm a big believer that really good management requires being what I like to call a no nonsense nurture. It goes back to my time as I when I was a teacher, sort of. Good managers are supportive of their teams. They are able to put their team members and positions to win and it's really clear on the team sense that the manager genuinely cares about them, their development and the well-being of each team member that SED rate. The manager has to have consistently high expectations to set those and hold up to that so that you know, you get sort of that, you know, quote UN quote no nonsense things that you're trying to get to, but. It comes always from someone who truly cares and is very actually in his investing in the team, actually being able to win, about to create value for them. Yeah, that's my management philosophy. I try to be a no nonsense nurturer whenever I can.",5.0
"I think broadly, ER teams doing pretty well. We've got a lot of people who are in roles they haven't done before, but generally they're developing right? So any, for example, is trying to be. More of a manager, but in this project means to. Trying to learn how to actually do a survey and how to analyze it and set it up, and you can see in the work that she's doing that there's a lot of things that are already there for the manager skill set, but she needs to continue to build out the actual poor hard skills that she's going to need to be able to coach and teach and lead with. Great. Then you can look at someone like Jeff, who's so competent at all the actual core functional analysis that we are trying to do. But. I think needs to stretch a little bit more into leadership to be able to bring someone like Camille along with him, as she's someone who's relatively new and hasn't actually. Had the experience doing the work that Jeff is doing. To be able to get there, so I think. Between that right, I want to sit down with Jeff and talked about being a good mentor to Camille and putting her into positions to succeed. And I want to sit down with Annie and walk her through the hard skills and make sure that I'm being a good teacher and that she can learn exactly what she needs to so that in her neck strap she can really knock it out of the park and make that case for her being a manager crystal clear.",
"So my boss obviously varies by project to project because who the partner is varies by project project, but generally right? Every single partner has to build relationships with clients, has to be a credible expert, has to continually sell high quality work to keep the practice moving and to ensure that we're developing as we need to, that we're developing our work and our perspectives as we need to combine with that right as equity owners of the company, they need to continue to build the practice, develop people and create an environment where everybody feels broadly comfortable with what needs to get done right so. That means oftentimes as a manager, I need to follow their lead and I need to actually execute on some of the things that they're doing in order to make sure that their goals are is effectively outlined and used as possible.",
"So, Alex, over the past couple days, I've noticed that some of the analysis we've been doing. Has it been, has been right that? There's been some errors in the way that you're going through the work and do it. I think actually what you're doing is like I used to do, which is I want to get something so quickly that I'm going to move really fast. And if it looks right, I'm not going to check that context, right. If you look at the analysis you did yesterday on, say, customer sizes and how many customers are broken down by size, right. Remember, what you're doing is. You're just taking the size across industry without thinking about the nuances in each industry, right? Uh, large healthcare company is very different than a large tech company and when you go through like that. You're going to get numbers that don't make a lot of sense. There's no way that 3/4 of their company customers are small. We know they play in the enterprise, but so need to do 2 things right. The first is. You've got to make sure you're moving quickly but not rushing. And going through and thinking through Haiti, here's exactly what the task is at hand and being able to go forward. But second, I need you to make sure that your. I need you to make sure that you're coming in and thinking about the work that you're doing in the context that you're doing it right. If an answer doesn't make sense, in all likelihood, it's not because there's probably something wrong with your work, right? If you've tripled checked your work and the answer doesn't still doesn't make sense right, come to me and we can talk about it and go through. But in all likelihood, that was mean to write. My answer doesn't make sense. Based on what I know and the work I've done, I probably made a mistake and we have to lean in and figure out exactly what that mistake was.",5.0
"OK, so we have to move really quickly on this, but we should be really effective. I think given there are four of us, we should be very able to accomplish this goal right? There really a couple key pieces to this puzzle. The first is the border, right? Easiest shapes to do. Jack, why don't you go and I want you to find every single border shape that has a flat edge and I want us to separate and start building out the frame of the puzzle. Then, James, you should hit the polar bear side. I want you to find every shape of the polar bear. Let's start building that polar bear together. Jimmy, why don't you go through on the tiger and build a tiger similar to what James was doing? And then finally, I know there's a big jungle that we need to get to. I'll go and try to find out all the jungle pieces and I'll try to get those at least separate and try to put them together as best we can. I know we're going to need to sort of build them around the polar bear and tiger, but after we put everything together, we can combine them and will be able to get our puzzle together.",5.0
"So the plan for my team is typically follows a pretty routine formula. Um, I start off by determining development needs of all of the team members. So that involves asking about any areas that team members feel that their weekend, any topics that they haven't had experience of, whether that's interviewing customers or building up a market model and also determining interest levels. So would they like to try something new they want to explore a new topic, new workstream, etc. Once I've had those individual conversations, um, then also think about. How the team members like to interact with myself and the broader team? Do they like to have daily checkins twice daily checkins, a check in once every every two or three days? Just to understand the pulse check and understand if people feel like they want more or less guidance? And obviously that varies a lot by seniority level and experience level. I didn't set up the daily um, set up the meeting cadence. Um. Also allocate the work streams, um, making sure that people are aligned with. Either topic areas that they're interested in or. Um, areas that they need to work on. And obviously a big part of that is, um, thinking about the needs of the client and trying to balance that with. The timeline and um. There's often mentioned development needs. Throughout the course of the projects, I think one thing that I I strongly encourages his enormous amount of communication, especially amongst the team members. Um, we work in an industry where there's a lot of dependencies between work streams, and so I would try and foster that dialogue by, um, ideally being open and transparent, but also encouraging people to speak to their fellow colleagues, either impersonal or virtually as well. Um, of course, a big part of this is just making sure. Kind of quality control in the work and thinking about how they can make improvements to their work throughout the projects and also into future projects as well.",5.0
"My management philosophy is somewhere between if you have two extremes of micromanagement and completely laissez-faire, giving them freedom to do whatever they want. I sort of leaned slightly more towards the not quite halfway, but slightly more towards giving giving team members more freedom. What that means is. I will give them um. Guidance and. A perspective on the ultimate objective and will give them enough time, whether it's a couple of hours or a couple of days. To think about how best to approach that problem, give them time to whether it's build the model or draft discussion guide or conducts in-depth research, and then I'll step in um after that time period is elapsed to give some feedback. What I do at the same time though, is I make sure that they are aware that I am there to jump in if necessary. But I try not to not to micromanage because that's the best way of learning, I believe.",5.0
"Overall, the team appears to be working effectively as a unit. Um, they're communicating very clearly with each other and with myself, giving me daily updates, which is giving me a good sense of progress. Um. There also seems to be very intellectually curious and I think what I would say overall is that the atmosphere amongst the team is very positive. At the beginning of each call we're able to have a few like drugs, but then we're able to kind of pivot quickly to some of the key issues. And what's great to see is that the team members are open and willing to share concerns and share ideas and really pitch in as well. Um. When it comes to helping each other out, so some of the team members are. Going above and beyond and actually offering their time, their expertise to other work streams, going effectively, going above the Call of Duty. And So what I think that means is that clearly the team are all sort of putting in the right direction. I think they will have a clear objective in mind. Um. And they're willing to, to be flexible to help each other out as well. Um, I think given that some of the team members are very new, this is the first project, um, I'm making an effort to give them some step opportunities given the fact that we have a longer timeline for this project. So some of the new associates are begins to conduct some expert interviews, beginning to do some of their own slide craft and hopefully this will be a good extension of their initial training program and so. I'll keep an eye on them and see how they how they progress and what their feedback is, but so far everything seems on track. Morale is high, productivity appears high as well, so looking forward to the rest of the project.",
"Well, festival have several bosses, but um in a more typical structure. My boss has several responsibilities first and foremost. Business development, so going out to the market. Pitching for work, UM winning business presenting the practices credentials. And explaining why we should be conducting the service, whether it's due diligence or or growth strategy exercise. Um, links with that is around 4 leadership so. To support those sales in my boss is um developing content expertise and becoming known as an SME within a certain or several one or one of a handful of um topic areas. Lastly, the main pillar of my bosses job is to quality control project delivery and show that we're meeting the expectations of the client.",

Um, I've noticed a few trends that are causing a little bit of concern over the past couple of weeks. We worked together several times in the past and you know you've, you've always been, uh, absolutely critical part of the team and delivered excellent work throughout. Um. I just want to see what's what might be happening because in in the last couple of weeks I've noticed that your deliverables have been at least two or three days late. I've had to go in and make quite a few edits directly and had a lot of comments as well. So the quality levels aren't quite what they used to be. And I wanted to know this is very much out of character and doesn't align a tool with your previous experience. You know that you can deliver excellent work on time and to high quality, so. Is there anything that's happening behind the scenes that I should be aware of? Um, do you feel that you need to take some time off or do you feel like I need to provide you with some more support? Are you finding this specific projects? Especially challenging. Please do let me know and we can. We can make some amends. Um, and even if it means that, I can give you some additional team members to support your worship, and very happy to do so if you're juggling multiple things outside of outside of. The project and also outside of work as well. So um. Please do let me know how I can. How can best be of help. Also suggest that we catch up in. Three or four days just to see how things are progressing and I would love to to see some improvement at that point. But as I said, please let me know how I can help and we can we can take any corrective measures. Thanks a lot for your time.",6.0
"Hi, team, very exciting challenge for us today. Um, we're competing with ten other teams to complete this puzzle as quickly as possible. So what I suggest we do is we divide up our responsibilities. I will kind of have oversight of the overall puzzle and make sure that the broader pieces are fitting together. The landscape is aligned with the tiger and polar bear. Just as the one of us is in charge of the edges so that if they can pull the edges together and create the outline, that would be awesome. If another team member could have ownership of the tiger and another one have ownership of the polar bear, obviously find pieces of the same of the right color of those two animals. Maybe can build those outside of the working area to save so it can be a bit more effective with time. And then in a few minutes I will come and then bring those pieces together we can start.

There are three different colors which are the basic rules for this team. The first one. Is a data management. So what? Data how importing, how quality that these data have, what processing means to learn so that we have a good repository uh, data warehouse with real time events of everything we just happen in the company this past the basic capability we just visibility. This function is basic to the second one, which is the detection engineering path. Those are experts on understanding from this data what can be considered malicious, the expert on creating queries, on understanding them, on hunting some malicious activities proactively. And to create the detections that will then then be managed. That comes to three pilot, which is after all. Those are people who experts are handling what has happened in the company, what has been identified by our detection engineers. Into resolving it so they know who to contact, they don't what to do.

And developing whatever measures need to be done better. I see myself more as a support the nazarite in light for the team. I try to lead by example. I don't expect that any problem that we have internally will be solved by my top manager or my manager manager. I try to put on these measures. I try to understand them, I try to help. And all together, collaboratively, we can create a bond and a confidence that can achieve hours as our diesels.",5.0
"I have been leading teams on, uh right number of functions for number of years now. And every time that I have come to a new domain, I feel that there is a number of needs that need to be attended to create a good and successful plan. The plan for a team that implements a corporate functions need to accommodate that the most important mission that we have, all the demands that come from the company to us. And also try to feel fit in the current members that are in need to implement these functions. And. Also think fresh, think out-of-the-box and think how could be done better or who could we enroll? In order to measure. UN succeed on delivering these functions. I would split this plan in three different workstreams. The first one is to scope the current number of tasks and the nature. What needs to be done? What can actually be done with the current staff and what needs to be a plan for the future in an iterative mode? If we ever need to increase our workforce or have nots, um new team members, we need to be sure what needs to recreate it. But we cannot do that with one shot. We cannot get it in two 1-2 days. We need to plan this and iterative and continuous mode. It was very important as I was saying the part number 2, which is assessing the current personnel skills, what can they do which this function will accommodate. And what are the capabilities are going to develop? Sometimes we have excellent people that we can develop. And can nurture into having an excellent professional in a new way that they haven't worked before and sometimes we will need to enroll someone new. The third part, which is very related to the second one, it's growing and developing our team. It's very important to understand who can be at the main leader on each of these tasks. And split our function so that they can lead a part of it. I don't think that there is a need to create a very vertical pyramidal hierarchy, but we can work in a flat hierarchy with coordinators that are empowered to one of these domains. It does have any important understand that we need to take undertake the plan from a tactical what can be done now and strategical perspective So what can be done and has to be in the future. And as always, there is no plan. That can survive the first battles and modified. It's very important to revisit, to review what we have been doing, understand which our metrics and KPIs. And improve our definition of tasks, our team members skills and everything which is related to our team day-to-day operations to succeed in the future.",5.0

"So hello, everyone. My name is Lena and I'm very, very happy to show you today a little bit more to tell you a little bit more about my doctoral thesis and what it is all about. And yeah, so therefore, let's start. Yeah. So first of all, the topic is about how can Auburn corporations and Mr Bishop more sustainable business travel environment. So basically where the people choose sustainable options. On their behalf, yeah. So how can one do that? So my first source of thought was, OK, we need to understand the personas. It's basically the business travelers first before we can start some interventions in order to change their behavior. To build those personas. I suggest taking an approach basically from software engineering or used in marketing as well, but you basically depending um song behavioral variables. You build clustered groups of people so to serve. And since I want to do this in combination with sustainability aspects, I use insights from this. See the research behavior but also on the other side from. Um, sustainability, little transform. And yeah, basically there is a, there's a concept also developed by another researcher and they found out that, um, sustainable travel, eh, sustainable behavior is always drive from two different factors, the capital factors, contextual factors and motivational factors. And basically what I will do, I will build the questions around this framework, but also considering insights from the other, um, from the. Higher studies from soft engineering. Yeah, so basically and once the system down I can build those clustered persona so to say and once we have them we can in order to decide OK, what to do now I work met him on a matrix on one axis there, the eco footprint on the other access to spend so and also from the size of the dogs basically indicating how many they are and one organizations and yeah basically from there we can go and look them which are the ones. That are most pressing to focus on. So for instance now one example could be that we are talking about consultants. So because they travel a lot and they used to travel like maybe very fast or they always go by plane somewhere. So maybe we want to have a closer look there and understand what can we do in order to. Order to incentivize them to choose to more sustainable travel options. And here we come, largely second part of my thesis, and this would be about notching mechanisms. So basically nutshells are just some small pushes, so to say, to push people into the intended behavior. So you're not fitting them anything, but basically you're just incentivizing them. For instance, setting defaults always makes people to choose rather certain option, but you're not forcing them. And yeah, and the second part, um, I will analyze 3 different cultures, and. Understand which of them are effective in changing their behavior. So. And with this I want to work together of course with the travel commodity within Siemens, but also have another startup that deals with similar topics as well. And yeah, I'm very happy to do that and looking forward to learn more and apply the theoretical knowledge in a practical environments. Somente cut.",5.0

"Hi there, I'm Alexandria, founder and CEO of Poplin. Eh Pregnancy Wellness company that helped couple helps couples get ready to get pregnant, starting with the most comprehensive lab tests on the market. So how did I get here? Well, it all started on a warm summer day in a macaroon shop in New York City. I was meeting with a former friend, former colleague and friend, and we were chatting, just catching up. She had gotten a new job, moved into a new apartment, and was sharing about her life and what had been going on. And we met up, and at some point she leaned in and in a. Fairly exasperated tone, she shared. I feel so confused. I'd like to think about myself as a smart, capable, resourceful person. I. I'm willing to do anything, I'm willing to pay anything, but nobody can tell me how to solve this problem. And at first I did no idea what she was talking about, and eventually I realized that she was talking about getting pregnant. She had been trying to get pregnant for the past year and nothing was working, and she was starting to lose faith in herself, in her body, in her future baby. And she was coming to me asking for my advice and perspective and guidance. And. Hoping that maybe I had a shred of perspective here and, um, that was when I thought, wow, there has to be, um, this seems like a solvable problem, and this is an important problem. It's it's worth looking into. And that's when I kind of started my search. I left the coffee shop that day determined, determined to figure out what was going on. I wanted to be a helpful friend and I wanted to be a resource. And so I started diving in. I dove into the research and I realized, Oh my gosh, she is absolutely correct. The resources. Out there were extremely lacking. There just weren't great resources. Most of the time we're approaching fertility in the context of infertility, and that is way too late. I knew there had to be a better way to approach this.",4.0
"Today, we're going to talk about the biggest myth infertility. Which is that age is the only predictor of fertility. And oftentimes when we think about that, we're actually referring to chronological age. But here's the thing. There is a big difference between chronological age and biological age. Chronological age is your age in years, and biological age is the vitality of your cells. It's kind of like the difference between the years in your life and the life in your years. And we in the fertility world use data that says. 30 year olds are created equal, or all 35 year olds are created equal, but that's simply not true. The way you live your life, the way that you eat and you move, the way that you relate, how you sleep, all of these things affect your biological age, and so while we might not be able to change our chronological age or aging years, they advance every single year. We can modulate our biological age. And this is really, really, really important information because it means that we have control. So much more control than we would lead to. Believe about our biological age and and therefore our fertility. And our fertility is an extension of our overall health. And therefore, our biological age is really important when it comes to fertility. And so again, the way that you move and the way that you sleep and the nutrients that you eat, all of these things influence your biological age, and they are changeable. Your body is so incredibly resilient. And so how you live your life is going to dictate the health of your egg cells and the health of your sperm cells if your mail. And so we can control so many different pieces of this puzzle, and it's not just about your chronological. Age. So the big take away here is that fertility is not just about your chronological age. It's much more about your biological age. And while we can't yet change our chronological age, we can change our biological age. So you are in control. That's the big message.",6.0

And as I was mentioning earlier, I worked with a lot of clients that were struggling to conceive their one year into their fertility journey, two years, three years. And they were had been poked and prodded and had a really emotionally, physically and financially draining experience. And I ended up running tests and found things that their doctor was not finding.

Um, I feel that I can ask questions and no one will think that I'm an idiot. I feel like I can call out behavior among my colleagues that's inappropriate. I feel that I can generally speak out and that my comments will be heard and listened to and respected, and I won't be punished or retaliated against. However, one thing that could really be improved is the decision making speed. Um, so specifically as we're trying to make shifts to our strategy. It takes a really, really long time for the leadership team I'm working with to listen, to evaluate and come back with a decisive. Signal response.

"What does an iPad and charger? A small French bulldog and a very heavy bag of onions all have in common. Well. They each weigh about four pounds. £4.00, that's pretty heavy, right?

A little bit less than a million inhabitants. That's £4 million of trash produced every single day. This is really alarming and it needs to stop.

But when I was finishing up my bachelors degree, I didn't really know what to do with that psychology major and so. My father talked me into getting an MBA. And I was able to do so thanks to opportunities that have been cultivated by the work I had done as an undergraduate student on the campus. I don't mean schoolwork. I mean work that I did in my extracurricular activities, leading organizations, promoting events and things of that nature. And so marketing became something that seemed worthy of study. My point, though, is that I never once considered. Media or advertising or where I am now, analytics is something that I was heading towards. I was oddly, uh, a split person between being interested in people. And being interested in in numbers and.

"How to cheat to make the best lasagna? I say cheap because I use a bunch of ingredients that are sort of pre prepared and I guess I'm not doing it exactly from scratch, but I can live with that because as far as I'm concerned when you're cooking food it's all about how it tastes in the end. There are two main sheets that are happening with lasagna. Number one, I only use the pasta lasagna that does not require to be boiled first. It's pre packaged, it cooks right in the lasagna dish and you don't have to worry about making it and fiddling with the lasagna sheets as you layer them and they're wet and they're sticking together and all that nonsense. The second main thing I do is that there's a store up here that sells a pre prepared bowl and A's sauce. And most people wouldn't think to put bohlini sauce in lasagna, but it's essentially a sauce that has meat in it. And that sounds like lasagna to me. So I use Balinese sauce and it's prepared already. It's in this nice canister. What I do is I mix the ricotta cheese with the bowl and A's sauce to create this bullonies ricotta monstrosity. I have my favorite sauce that I buy at the store. Another cheat layer the sauce down, put the first layer of hard lasagnas not that. Already cooked stuff because I can. Then I layer on my monstrosity of Balinese and ricotta cheese. With that, I just build it up one layer at a time, as you're supposed to do. I use an enormous amount of mozzarella and very healthy. I put a lot of salt in it, as well as other seasonings. I kind of just go with what strikes me. In the end, they make sure I have both enough sauce to cover the entire top and an insane amount of mozzarella to add. So that you have that wonderful burnt crispy cheese. Amazing goodness.

"Hello everyone I am going to give you some tips and tricks. For helping make this Nalgene bottle that much more functional in your daily activities now, the truth of the matter is this basic water bottle. Specially when you're out West in the heat and the humidity and even the elevation can be a problem. It really can. What you put in is cold water in the beginning of the day can become frightfully hot by about, oh, 12:00 o'clock in the afternoon. So what I'm going to teach us to do is how do you keep this water cold? The first thing to do is to fill it up only halfway. Fill it up only halfway. And then deposit the bottle in the freezer. Keep it in there for about 6 hours until it's solid and frozen, then take the bottle out and pour water in the remaining space in the bottle. I guarantee you that will keep your water colder and more refreshing as you go about your activities. And if that's not enough for just a few dollars, you can buy this neoprene sock that will give it the insulation it needs to get you through the whole day.

"I'd like to talk to you about, um, ESG. ESG is an acronym that's getting a lot of attention these days. It stands for environment, social and governance, and it reflects the corporate responsibility and D and I efforts of a company. Basically, the sustainability and the ethical impact of an organization. ESG reporting and investing is becoming increasingly important to internal and external stakeholders. Like shareholders, investors, regulators, employers, suppliers and customers, and it's quickly taking on more significance with climate change and social justice topics becoming issues around the world. So both public and private companies with positive ESG metrics also do better on many fronts, including higher financials, greater efficiencies and higher employee satisfaction. So HR functions can make a really big contribution to ESG efforts for an organization. And the way they can do this is with good recruitment practices, employee engagement and demonstrating good practices for being inclusive and diverse in their workforce and how they AH train, how they attract, retain and work with their workforce. And these efforts also helped to. Mitigate risks such as employment issues and negative sentiment that can affect your brand reputation. So key areas for HR, our talent, planning. This includes recruitment and promotion practices and performance and compensation. So if you have data analytics that can prove that you're measuring and reporting your people stats as your recruiting people, that's really helpful to an ESG report.",5.0

Um, there is a yurt hosted by a man named Jonathan on his farm. This is available through Airb can book. Very inexpensive. Jonathan has built out an amazing Oasis on his property. Um, he's got. A sauna. Um, a full inground living pool area. There's a great town and Randolph with lots of micro breweries you can really unplug from the city life. He's got a cowboy hot tub where you can relax under the stars outside. So All in all, 10 out of 10 bucolic farm vibes. Great to vacation.",
"One thing that has been going really well recently in the office is our back to work plan. Um, we've landed on A2, um, two in person days hybrid work environment and I found that it's really nice to have the time in person with the team for collaboration in person meetings. That has been going really, really well while also allowing for flexibility for everyone schedules. One thing that can be improved, um, now that we are in office two days a week and we've we have core days, um, it can be a little bit tough to book a conference room. And as a person with a very meeting heavy schedule, um, it would be great to have a couple more conference rooms available so we can can book the rooms for our meetings.",3.0

"So I ended up in my career kind of indirectly by following kind of things that I love to do in my personal life. But I started out just by going to New York City where there were a lot of opportunities and a lot of jobs and to have a lot of fun. And my first job was in like a financial insurance type of company that eventually was bought by Bank of America, but while I knew that the content and having to wear suit. Every day with didn't really fit my best authentic self. I was fortunate to have a lot of great leadership and just to learn how to be in a professional environment, how to show up at work. In in my free time I played a lot of intramural sports, basketball, tennis, soccer, and through my basketball team I met a woman who was in recruitment at an advertising agency and sent her my resume. And that is how I ended up in my career. It was dynamic and I was learning different things all the time. It was a bit more, I guess, you know, casual and free spirited, which suited me. I met a lot of wonderful people and was able to grow. Personally and professionally. And so for me it was really through kind of following my passion points, being my most authentic self and you know, through trust and eventually building a network of accountability and follow through that really, you know, led me to where I am today. And so I think that those connections with people and with yourself are some of the most important things in business. And I still, you know. Have those. Colleagues and previous colleagues today and it's a big treasure.",3.0
"One of my favorite games is boggle. Growing up, my family and I loved word games with something we did around the holidays or during downtime, and we're competitive group, so it was always very spirited and it's a tradition. Then I would, you know, like to continue with my son as he gets a little bit older and just foster a love of words and communication and competitive spirit and fun. So boggle. You have the boggle box with all the letters in it, and the goal is to write down on your own, um, quietly, a list of words by connecting with the letters that connect to create a word. So you want to find as many words as you can on the Bible. Bored by connecting letters that touch each other? You have one minute. So there is a time limit and it's kind of a Reese to find as many words as you can write them down. And you want the words to be at least three letters long, so 3-4 or five letter words. And then ultimately after a minute when everyone the time is up, pencils down one person. I'll read their list of words and if anyone else has the same word you cross it out. And that word doesn't count. So you want to see how many unique words you end up with that you found that no one else found. So it's kind of an additional challenge when you're searching the board. And as you get a little more experience to try to find those words that you think other people won't come up with or that are a little longer, that also helps your score. So three letter words are worth 1.4 letter words are worth 2 points. Five letter words or more. Or three points. So at the end, when you score all the words that you have that no one else has, you total your points and that is your score for that round. And you can play as many rounds as you want. Enjoy.",5.0

Look around our enterprise and understand all the great solutions and products that are being developed, but that are often in silos.

"It's interesting because I think one thing that is going very well and one thing that could use improvement is really the same thing in some ways we have great communication at horizon about culture, about current events, about even, you know, personal lives where people want to share and really connect about things outside the workplace that, you know, impact us as humans. Um, where we don't have as much communication and where we could be a lot more effective is actually about the work that we're doing. And a lot of that work because people are so busy and so focused and so, um, vertically capable, there is a little bit of a lack of picking our heads up and looking across and thinking, oh, I should share and connect this to someone else is work as well.

"On average, a person walks about seven and a half thousand steps a day. That's actually much higher than I would have thought. It's nearly five miles a day, and I would say as in New Yorker. You know, that is probably about how much I walk a day, and I I consider myself to walk quite a bit. Maybe I'm walking more than that, but about 5 miles a day? Um is great. It's great for the average person, although about 10,000 steps is apparently the kind of the goal. But for people who hop in and out of a car and mostly drive, I think it's a great goal to walk 7500 miles, 75, seven, 1500 steps a day. Um, it's about 20 times around a track if you want to think of it like that. Um, so I think that's great. And as in New Yorker, I am all about walking.",4.0
"I ended up in a Chief People Officer role, I believe, because I've always had a great interest in people and the way they think and what motivates them. But back when I graduated from college, although I was a psychology major, I was a little bit directionless and where I wanted to take that. And I remember talking to a friend and saying, well, you know, I really love people, I love gatherings, I love bringing people together and it might really be a great career to be in offense. And she said, you know? That would be, that would be interesting for you, but I just went through the campus recruiting process and actually I met a recruiter who did a really amazing job of bringing me along and telling me about different career paths through events. And that could be a really interesting thing to explore. And so with that, I applied and received my first role in campus recruiting. And from there I've spent the next really 15 years or so at different companies, both large and small, in a variety of. Recruiting and eventually other people roles, which eventually led me to Brooklyn, into this Chief People Officer role that I'm in now. And you know, looking back in retrospect, the way I fell into this seems so coincidental. But at the same time, it seems like in some ways it was really meant to be because I was always the one growing up who people came to for advice, who listened, who made suggestions, and I do a ton of that in my. Roll today and really enjoy it and it brings me a lot of energy, so that's really how I got into this path. A little bit of an accident, but makes a lot of sense when I think about it deeply.",4.0
"Hi, everyone. I'm Jamie and I'm going to teach you how to conduct an interview for a job that you're hiring for on your team in a way that will get you a great candidate who is truly a strong match for the role that you have open on your team. So the first thing to do is to really think about the top five non-negotiable qualities, whether they be technical skills or soft skills or the way someone will approach their job that are critical. To someone succeeding in the role. So the first thing you're going to do is really think deeply and write down those 5 qualities. Then the next thing to do is to think about a question you can ask about someone's past experience that would demonstrate whether or not they have the experience either doing that technical skill or displaying that quality. So, for example, if strong communication skills are really critical to the job, you might think of a question that says that is along the lines of tell me about a time when you had to communicate a very complex topic to an audience. That didn't know that much about that topic, and have them walk you through their process and the outcome. Then the next thing to think about before you go into the interview is what makes an OK answer, a good answer, and a great answer. So you have sort of a scoring rubric that you can go back to as you go through the interview and ask your questions across the attributes you've selected. You can actually grade each candidate on where they fall on that rubric in a way that's fair and consistent and therefore lacks bias. That can enter its way into the interview process. So then you go through your questions, you score, you can compare candidates across each other, and you should be able to make a really strong hiring decision even if you only have 1/2 hour or 45 minutes to interview someone.",6.0

I think what I love about it is there's a really great mix of things to do but also relaxing. It's. Wrestled and beautiful mountains you can hike during the day, you can walk through town. There's tons of shopping, food, restaurants, wine tasting rooms.

"We have a really great workplace culture and work environment and when most people ask me, I would usually describe it as it really fun and light and engaged workplace, but also one where people are really serious about their work and what they do.

That creates a really awesome work environment. Even when there are challenges, as long as you have good people who are willing to collaborate effectively, you can really work through anything. One thing to improve, and I think this is because we're a high growth company and we've been growing so much over the last few years, one thing that can be improved is probably our ability to strategically plan ahead and communicate those plans. If we were able to do that a little bit better, people would certainly be able to plan their own work better and the work.

You work or you sit at a desk all day. Here are two things that I do to try to get my steps in even though I don't usually hit 7500. Number one is have a walking meeting, so if there is a phone call that you can if you work remotely that you can do while you walk, do that. If you're in person and you don't need to look at a screen, take that meeting outside for a walk. The second thing would be to lengthen your commute on purpose.

"Hi, my name is Sarah Fitz and I am currently a partner at the law firm of Aaron Fox Shift. This is almost a second career for me.

Schiff is a chicago-based firm and the move from being in a New York centric firm to eh Chicago firm really engendered a surprising amount of culture shock just in terms of attitude and approach. I.

"Hi. I'm going to tell you the perfect way to grill a chicken leg using a Japanese technique. So normally when you grill a chicken leg, it's challenging because you've got the meat with the bone inside and it cooks unevenly, and it can get really dried out, or this skin can get really charged because you overcook it to get the internal temperature to the right level. So here's the trick. Take the chicken leg. Put it in your hand. Scissor Kitchen scissors works better than a knife. If you use a knife, put it down on a chopping block so you don't cut yourself. But I prefer scissor and what you do is you cut. A slice on either side of the bone and then pull the chicken open. So now you've got a piece of meat that's flatter. Then you can just rub any spice rub of your choice on it. Put it on a hot grill. Start skin side ground, not on direct flame. Turn every two to three minutes or so, alternating with direct flame after it started to brown. Uh. If you want to use a BBQ sauce, you have to be careful because the sugar in a BBQ sauce. Will make the chicken char fast, but brush it on lightly after it started to cook, turning periodically, brushing the top each time you turn until the chicken is done, which you can tack with an internal electronic temperature gauge. Or you can just tell by the nick and peak technique, which is a polite way of saying you take a knife and you can make a little cut and make sure it's cut. But now, instead of having to worry about pink meat along the bone edge 'cause it didn't get cooked. It's always perfect.",6.0

"Good morning. This is a tech check. Today I'll run through our proposition on social enterprise and social value. And take you through some of our key objectives before you go and brainstorm how you can support these objectives and drive forward the social movement within Siemens PLC. The idea is. That we develop our procurement with purpose approach, doing more good with our everyday spend, delivering societal impact. For the societies that we serve. And ensuring that. We build on our social and environmental opportunities. Thank you.",
"Good morning, cohort. Today I'd like to talk to you about Siemens partnership with Social Enterprise UK and how we are driving the social value movement into our supply chain, into our businesses and supporting science society to do more good. Back in 2020. Our supply chain Management UK team partnered with Social Enterprise UK on there by social corporate challenge. We're one of 30 corporate partners across the UK committed to spending a billion pounds with social enterprises by 2025 and the current baseline is 250 million, cumulative, cumulative baseline is 250 million. So we've got some way to go. What are social enterprises, you may ask? Well, they do business differently. They don't exist. To fund shareholders, they plow a minimum of 50% of their profits back into social and environmental projects, both in the UK and internationally. Examples could be helping the homeless back into society, rehabilitating prisoners back into everyday life, supporting children in the care system or cleaning our oceans. Many, many positive impact opportunities, and it's a simple case of doing more good with our everyday spend. They tend to work in the indirect spend commodity, which is why I'm engaging with you today and I will take you through some of the objectives we got in place and at the end of this session you can go and brainstorm how you can support and help us scale the social movements across our business. So our aspiration as an organization, we have 14,000 employees in the UK. For every Siemens employee, we want to positively impact a member of society's life. So that's 14,000 people we want to help. That's our main aspiration. How can we do that? Well, by bringing more social enterprises into our supply chain. We already have 55. By 2025 we want to have 250. We're currently spending around £2 million a year through those 55 businesses. By 2025 we want that to be near a 10 million. U as teams can help us do that. How? Look at where we can bring these wonderful businesses into our supply chain and that may be a direct contract with Siemens or it may be through one of our tier one partners. And whilst engaging with our tier one partners, why not influenced them to also participate in the social movements and then use their indirect spend? How else can you support we want to influence our businesses? So that they challenge there too on suppliers to also engage. We want to influence our country teams overseas so that social movements starts to grow in Germany, in the Netherlands, in France, in Czech Republic, everywhere where Siemens has a presence. Now what I'd like to do, you've heard our key objectives. I'd like you to break into groups, brainstorm how we can adopt those objectives and how you can support in delivering the social movements, driving procurement with purpose across our organization and into our supply chain. I look forward to hearing your thoughts. Thank you very much.",6.0

This topic makes me so very happy to discuss because very often we hear about the opposite, about times where things don't go well or collaboration is a little bit bumpy. And I've had the honor and the pleasure of actually working with a woman named Alexandra Novakova within my organization we are partnering to create. A whole new framework for competencies for the organization. Um, Alex and I came together because she actually led the pilot of this program in 2020 when we went into COVID. She's leading the talent acquisition team or she's one of the leaders on the Talent acquisition team. And so they used competencies quite a lot for um scouting, new talent and recruitment, but we weren't using them internally. And a way that was really supportive for the organization at large. And so we came together with me with the lens of the eye and creating an equitable foundation for people to know how to navigate their careers. And her from the Teesside, understanding how to engage with the marketplace and having history for what the project has been in past iteration.

"Hello everyone. Good afternoon. My name is Fatima Winfrey and I am here today to talk to you about creative expression through your hair. OK, so my 2 minutes teach is going to be about how to decide your hair expression for the day. Very often a lot of us wear the same hairstyle or the same haircut every day every week. So if you're in the mood for something new, you might be wondering how do I go about it, right? And so first I want to ask you to. Think about your mood. Um, let's say you're going in to completely change your hairstyle, and it's not just something new you want to do for this one day. What is the mood? What is the personality that you want to evoke? And then what sort of hairstyle? If you think about that person, do they typically have? So if I decide that I want to start to evoke? CEO Energy, right. What does a leading woman CEO look like in my mind, right? Because that would be the blueprint that I would like to follow. And so if you get a couple of examples you can Google Online. So I'm like boss babes or anything of that nature. To get yourself started. Once you have a couple of examples, you can make some decisions. So maybe you found a CEO online who has a sleek Bob cut and that's one look. And he found another who has big, voluminous bouncy curls, and that's another look. Or maybe you found someone who's really throwing all convention out of the window and has like, big curly red hair or big curly purple hair. And not to look. Once you have your options, you can then choose which of those fields most authentic to you. And from there, it's about choosing that stylist. So once you've decided you're look, follow for Part 2 on this island.",5.0

So really, I am the integral Strategic Center for how we think about making horizon systems equitable for all employees, making sure that we have. A diverse workplace, partnering with our talent recruitment team and then making sure that we can keep that really strong talent once they're in the door. And then of course inclusion and belonging, which means I help make sure that we have systems and processes in place so that all employees feel that they have a voice and that their respected within our walls for their individuality.",5.0
"Hello, I'm here to tell you why you should go to my favorite vacation destination of the world, Jamaica. So first and foremost the food is so delicious. It's out of this world. And what is a good vacation? If you're not having good food, then to go along with that good food. They have the best, most strong, but in a good way. Rum punch that I've had anywhere else. And the sun is always shining and the people are so friendly. It's the best combination of being able to have some relaxation outdoors, sun, good food, feeling well fed and well taken care of. And then one of my favorite things about it is that Monte Go Bay is actually one of only four places in the world that have a bioluminescent Bay where the water actually glows when you get in it. It's such a sight to see and I highly recommend so check it out.",
"Hi everyone. My name is Fatima and I work at Horizon Media. So I want to tell you a little bit about my workplace and what makes it great. Um, firstly, from my perspective, the best thing about horizon is that we do have a commitment to being an agency of belonging. And So what that means is that we are really committed to making sure that every employee gets to feel like they belong as the individual that they are in such a powerful sentiment and not one that's often associated with corporate America. So I would say that's one of the greatest things about my company. It really does live inside of the culture, that commitment, and you'll see it inside of most individuals that you need. Um, one of the things that I would say is an area of opportunity for horizon is becoming more process organized. So we have a lot of really great thinking and a lot of innovation that comes out, but not always a good way to flow through. And so it's the best agency of belonging and the area of opportunity having some organization and process.",5.0
"When you hear the number 4, does that sound very big? I would say knowing that numbers go from zero to Infinity, the answer is probably no. But when you think about the fact that the average person creates 4 pounds of trash every day. That looks like. One of these things filled every single day of your life. On average, if you live to the age of 80, your number four turns into 116,800 pounds of trash over the course of your life. Just think about that for one second. So what I want you to come away with today is Dolittle. Numbers count. I think we can agree that the answer is yes. So as you go about your day, consider where you can snip away some of that trash.",5.0
"Through what is the one SRM process, why do we use it and what are the different types of shopping carts that we can actually use within one SRM? So one SRAM is a tool she's fronting tool where we can actually use for indirect cure meant it enables you as the end user to actually raise requisitions which there could be turned into purchase orders and then actually convert it into a PO which is fully approved by your business unit. The key to. Processes to follow are the free text and a limit order. A free text is a physical item where you have a fixed price and a fixed quantity. Where limit item is a bucket blanket order framework called it is also referred to, and that's where you have a pot of money where you're expecting multiple invoices over a period of time at different values. They are the two different types of shopping carts that we use in one SRM, but the process itself, there are eight fundamental steps within one SRM which take us through that journey. Of creation of a shopping cart through Tapio Creation and then to the invoice which is actually created and controlled in the back end system. Firstly you as the actual end user your creator repetition where you're putting demand in its respective its description, price, quantity, attach your quote and then once you click on submit that will then go to Step 2 in the process and Step 2 is where supply chain management are involved. That enables us to control to ensure that you followed the right process used to correct vendors and actually assign the correct rates depending on if it looking at maybe training ETC. So that's where you'll see somebody from supply chain management within the shopping cart workflow. Once we've approved that will then goes to step Step 3 and that's what we call the sourcing cockpit and that's where the actual shopping cart will be converted into a PEO by India. So Bangalore provide us that service in GBS they do some mandatory checks again to make sure that you send code is right as per this description. Once they've released it, it will then go into step four and step forward with a shopping cart has now been turned into a purchase order and this is the first time where you will see people from your. Business unit who will be approving the purchase order. We have 3 levels of purchase or at least three levels of approval. Zero to 5000 is Level 2, Level 3 is 5020 and Level 4 is 20 and above. So your business would have decided who the approval will be or approvers 'cause there can be more than one and at what level and at what cost center they will approve against. Once the purchase has been fully approved by our business, this will then be converted and released and sent to the vendor. So only at this point will a vendor received the PEO and it is at this point where you can give the PEO number out to the vendor. At the same time, a copy of the purchase order is sent to the back end ERP system and for the majority of us that is actually spirit him. Step Five is your response now we've not activated it in UK because there's it's too, um app, too much of a manual process, so we have not activated Step 5 in our process. Step 6 is a good perceive a confirmation. Now you is the end user. If it is a an item where you buy open free text are required. Will be required to create a good receipt. If you don't and the invoices posted against it, this will cause workflow, which you will then have to go. Ah, you'll get notification. You'll have to come into this system, complete the goods receipt, or you'd have to actually go to somebody in your goods into apartment and get them to complete their could see in spirit and. Step 7 and step 8 all to do with invoice. So the invoices posted into the back end ERP system. It is then released by sat by people in a position unit and that is the process complete. If you have any questions, please ask now. Many thanks for listening.",4.0
"Good afternoon. My name is Phil Allen, I'm from Siemens and I'm going to tell you about 1 SRM and how it works. Today we can look at one of them in a different shopping carts that you can create within the system. We have a free text, a limit order and a catalog. The catalog is the simple one. This enables you to actually go into eh vendors catalog and identify items from let's say Amazon. Select what you want, checkout, assign your cost center, pick on order, submit and that's your order made. Thing goes off for approval and is then hopefully once it's fully approved the order of center Amazon. The next one is a free text order. Free checks order is something that you cannot buy physically from a catalog and therefore you Drazen free texts order with the description, price or quantity. Fill in the GL code cost Center, click on order and that will then also be converted into A P oh and the last one is a limit and limit is for a blanket for service. Exactly the same process. Thank you for listening.",

"Good morning, everybody. Welcome to today's Digital Minds workshop. My name is Hamish Rogers and the temp labor commodity manager for seniors in the UK. I'm your facilitator for today's workshop, which is all about process is process automation, specifically relating to temp labor and the way we engage temp labor. From a process perspective. Before we start, there's a few house rules can say that to please turn your mobile phones to off or too silent to get you get the best concentration. But also as we go through the session, if you've got any questions, queries please put your hand up virtually. Ask a question clarification because you're probably not the only one that requires that sort of imports, so please shout up, but will make a start in a few seconds. Just to reiterate that today's workshop is all about process automation, so gathering of minds to see how we can document that. OK, so let's make a start. Um, in front of you on the screen is a concept board and you can stay on there. We gotta session plan which details at the various different things were going to go through. Um. Number one, from 10:30, I'll go through a brief presentation to give you an overview of what process automation is, what the key steps are in the process and that should hate age you as you go through the breakout sessions. So 11:00, o'clock, we'll have the first of our breakout sessions. We've documented each of those teams you can see on screen. There also be a link made available where you can go into virtual rooms where we can get together and discuss the topic that we want you to go through and the first breakout session. Relates to documenting the current manual process that you use to hire temporary workers. So in your breakout sessions there will be 4IN accession and there be someone from finance, something from resourcing soon from hiring management or project management and simply from it. You want to brainstorm the key steps that you go through to hire A temp worker from initial resource included payments from a manual perspective, keep it quite high level down with too much detail. Right now it's just so we can get it. An idea of you know what the steps are. Um, once you've done that, will come back to the main group on the concept board and will share those ideas around. Will have an open discussion so we can come to a consensus of opinion about what those steps are. That will take us up until about 12:00 o'clock. And from there, we'll probably quick break for 10 minutes and get some lunch in a coffee, etc. And then when we regroup at one around about 1:00 o'clock, we will then go through another breakout session. But in this case, we will have separate breakout or virtual rooms where everybody can make. But in this case, it will be subject matter expert. So all the finance people together or that people together, all the recruitment people together. So you can then brainstorm those face different steps will come up with to understand how you can actually digitize that process. What things would need to put in place to take a manual process into a digital process that will take about another hour up until maybe 2:00 o'clock. And then from there we can come back into the main group on the concept board and put those eyes to get ideas together. And we can focus on through a group discussion with everybody's input as to what they would like to see, how we can, what steps we need to put in place to bring about an automated process from the current manual process. If there's any questions, let me know. Um, if not, then we'll start. With the presentation from yourself. But as I say, please do ask questions as we go through this. Thank you.",2.0

"Good morning, and welcome to today's touring workshop Minings Paul Dunk. Um, and I'm going to be your facilitator for the next few hours. In relation to this workshop. This workshop subjective is basically to formulate a plan about how we're going to move. I TuneIn operations that currently operate here in Newcastle offsite to our supplier power. To do this, I put together an agenda, which you can see in the screens above here, which I'm just going to take you through now. So first of all, I mean gender, we're going to start off with some introductions. That's going to be followed by a recap about what we require from power. So what service requirements do we need from Ch power? After that seek power put together a proposal for us which they're going to take us through. So that's going to highlight what activities needs to happen to move the operations from Newcastle to their site in Doncaster, Plus also the costs associated with that. And finally we're going to formulate a plan. So after that presentations, hopefully that's going to be the basis and the bones for what we we need, but we might need to add and adjust that. So we're going to formulate a plan about who needs to do what to get, you know the tooling services successfully moved from here to seek power. So first thing on the agenda, some introductions, which I'm going to start off. Ah, my name is Paul Duncomb. I work in indirect purchasing, so supply chain management for Siemens, and I like to see each power national basis. So I'm going to pass. Introduction to software. That's OK. We'll go around the table to the right. So thank you all for introducing yourself. Now answer the second part of the agenda and that is to run through of what we require from our supplier power. So I want this to be interactive. So if there's things out there that you think shouldn't be there or I missed something or you don't agree with this statement, please you know shout up, let's have a debate about it. It's very important that we communicate what we want from power 'cause that's going to be basis other contracts. And it's going to be successful if we get this right. So let me start off with what we require. I've done this three sections. So the first section is toolkits, containers, the SEC is consumables and the third thing is what we require from the factory and other. So. What we require from our suppliers in relation to toolkits containers is when the toolkit comes back from site CHP, any tab and look at that container they need to make sure that. You know, is there anything to be repaired? They repair, it's, you know, some things might need to be scrapped so that can be scrapped, and also some things might be replaced, so they need to do that. They need to inspect it, see what needs to be replaced, and get it up to what we need it to be up to. The second thing they need to do is that there's going to be some product that needs to be calibrated or pat tested. There's going to be some lifting equipment that needs to be certified. So all those things we need to make sure that the ring cow, their impact, that being PAT tested and also that the lifting equipment. So I've got the right certification. We want them to that certification, we want them to put that on our website and we want that access to the website, to the key stakeholders on site and here at Newcastle. And lastly what we want them to do is to have the ability to deliver those containers from Doncaster to where we need them on site. So that is a toolkit and container requirements. Um, hopefully got that right. Is everyone happy with that? Do we need to add anything to need to change anything? Um, OK, that's great. Let's move on to what we require from consumables.",3.0
"So again, just consistency.",
"Welcome to charter free um. This chapter is called the future of procurement. In this section, we're going to look at the global trends changing the world and their impact on our work in procurement. And the chapter consists of two sections. So section eh is the impact on our function, which is SCM. And have a look at the various trends described on the trend cards below and drag them onto the DART board below. In this section, we don't want you to overthink it. You have about a minute trend, um, so some might be less obviously connected to procurement, but take it as a chance to broaden horizon and find a connection to the procurement function. And have a brief discussion with the team about them and how it affects it. Section B is new roles of procurement. So as you all know in procurement it's always changing and there's less value on. Cost cutting and more value on. Value added and doing well in the environment. Based on the findings, think about the new rules procurement she'll fulfill to be successful. And in the context these trading cards folks on the trends towards sensory dartboard and combine them if useful and then come up with precise we in procurement as cards. For example, we in procurement this drivers of digitalization stick with those one word sentences for now and then we'll detail and then the next chapter. Just scrolling down um, and then we go. So then we get have 10 minutes for the introduction, which we've just done, and you'll have 20 minutes. It's Group A and Group B to brainstorm on the impact in our function, which is just here as you can see. So you want to place your train cards on the dartboard, and it goes from low impact, high impact in the middle. Um, so Group B is gonna drop out the session now to a breakout room. Um, and then grew based? Eh here? And then after that we're going to have a 15 minute break where each team swaps um. Swaps boards and you can look at each others team well. You can look at the other team and then compare with your own and see how the the opinions vary. After that, um, we have 20 minutes and each team has a look at the others dart boards and trend cards near 2 circles. Please specify the impacts on procurement on post it notes and pose them next to the respective cards in the inner circle. And then we will swap back to each team and you can see what the other team has done on your work and their comments associated with it. So the breakout rooms are as follows and group, eh, we've got banned, we've got Sarah, you and and DMR. And then in Group B we've got Ben. See? K. And Zoe? Um, and just before you go, just have a look at what I'm showing on the screen now. So this is an example of what you're gonna have to do in, in the workshop. Um, so you just go from low impact, high impacts and basically just talk as a team, share your ideas, and then just decide where it goes on that board. Uh, nothing. Just just to let you all know there's nothing wrong with any idea, it's just your own opinion and obviously we'll discuss it after and see how the opinions vary, but that's the whole point of the exercise really, just to see how everyones opinions are different. And what what you sort of prioritize?",5.0

"Good afternoon calling here and I have the great pleasure of taking you through the final chapter of your digital mind journey. OK, today we're going to be talking about the mind treasure hunt. Yep, er, it's time to turn your pirate impressions on and look for the treasure, the coins. They can be found easy in this game, so let me explain what it involves a little bit. OK, first of all. This challenge is so. 535 challenges in the DG Mind application that y'all now have access to, and they range for a variety of things such as. How to um? Discover your strengths in digitalization. OK, so that's about strengths. Go OK, that takes 30 minutes. Really easy. Complete the survey. Discover your strengths. Bit more complicated things like, um, hosting or becoming a vuca ambassador or uh. Ted Talker is on there as well. Might take a few hours. Um. But again, just about you approaching the digits in mind with, uh, the right mindset. I think. One of my favorite challenges on there is building up in three hours. Using Mendix, it's absolutely. One, not for the faint hearted, but hey, who knows? In three hours you can build your own application. I didn't know how to do that. Done. It wants fabulous. Never look back. So you get the idea, I mean. Another one is. How to kill a stupid rule? OK, there's many stupid rules in Siemens. Uh, I'm sure you can find one. Again, very simple and it just takes you through the steps on what you need to do to really embrace the digital mindset that you've been learning about over the last couple of days now. Fine, you do the challenges. You complete them. Lots of challenge cards on there. What do you do next? You go to your eh teams that you've already established, and you sit together and you exchange the knowledge you've learned. So you share your experiences, how you found the challenges with it worthwhile. Is there a better one out there? Hey, just share about it and they'll support you. They'll be your natural support network to help you. Um, complete challenges. I should go and maybe give you some advice. The third element is actually the rewards. OK, so this is the bit you've all been waiting for. You get rewards for doing these challenges now coins equal prizes. Um, collect more coins for the more complex challenges that are on there. The main thing is the sum of the challenges and prizes that are on there can't be bought from anywhere. So one example is you could have eh? Coffee with Klaus, Talbots, err ahead of SCM. You could also perhaps when a sporting event ticket too much of your choice or a concert of your choice is also on there. And to be honest, there's a robotic Hoover on there as well. You know, there's just so many great prizes, small, um, big that you can be one just by simply. Going through these challenges, winning coins and sharing them with your teams. Um, so we hope you'll embrace it. Um, I know we're all pretty much busy bees these days. OK, there's my friend Mr. Big, but forgot your own pace. OK, you don't have to do all the challenges in week one, and you don't have to do any in week one. Go at the pace that suits you best. This app remains open to you for the duration for next whatever months and years it takes you. So you might do a few challenges one month and not find their time the next book. I really would encourage you try and find the time in the diary. Put a slot at least maybe half an hour, an hour, a week, whatever you can do just to at least remind yourself that these challenger available for you know, fully help you embrace the digital mind.",4.0
"It's easy to imagine, um, plane landing and having an accident. Hopefully something that doesn't happen very much, but it's easy to imagine. Um, but not not many people think about the same thing happening to, uh, ship entering harbor. And yet in the port of Barcelona, which is where I live, um, this has happened. Almost happened twice in the recent years. So a very big ship entering the harbor and almost crashing with the building. And part of the reason is that the captain was going really, really fast. But also there's another problem. Which is that the ships have a system called eh S. Yeah, just exactly the same system that the planes have to locate exactly the geographical coordinates of the sheep in uh in a scream so that the people in the control tower can guide them in the maneuvers of the entering the harbor. The problem is that many ships have these eh system but configured, which doesn't happen in planes. Planes all have them there. Eh is perfect, but not in ships. So, um. The port of Barcelona approached IBM to see if we could envision something that could give them control of how to locate ships without having to depend on the captain of the ship or the ship itself. And basically what they asked us was to make this geographical location of the ships using cameras, which seems very easy, but actually it's pretty tricky. It involves artificially intelligent models for screen image recognition. Involves involves IoT, involves 5G networks, but this is the job of my team, the client engineering team and this type of innovations Co creating with the customers is exactly what we do.

They have to move from a very, very batch oriented system for that transaction. I mean the transaction from their code banking system to the front office systems, the ATM, the bunker jonesie is the way you pay. In retail shops you know with your credit card, so this was based on very originel a bit old fashioned solution with caulking system running on batch mode, meaning everything was running during the night with lots of calculation for um in systems like mainframe on this type of machines you know. And now they want to shift to this new trend where consumer one immediate access to their information, real time information. Accurate information about their bunks bunking, bunking, account status, credits, mortgage, etc. And this is this shift has a lot of impact on the IT transformation for bug. I'm very, very engaged on how to move from this one step at a one step be you know it's very impactful on IBM technology can give a lot of help on how they do that on how they construct the journey.

We still are. Polluting our oceans or air. We are in the climate crisis and we need to come up with smart solutions to become more sustainable. It starts with data. We need to understand better the processes that are in place, to optimize them, to save energy, to save materials, to reuse them, to leverage what we. The sun and the natural processes are generating everyday. But if we are looking at data, there is another big problem that the information technology itself also consumes a lot of energy.

Issues that are discovered too late in data pipelines data quality, the lack of data lineages, and data pipeline maintenance issues. On the other hand, software engineering has by and large already solved most of these problems via tools and practices like DevOps, Agile source control, CICD, pipeline, unit testing, containerization, observe ability. These advances in the tools and processes have tremendously contributed to the acceleration of software development lifecycle. So isn't it about time that data engineering applies the same principles? Of course, with data comes more complexity. And we have to deal with the weight that data brings in. And. And also get additional complexity that the data brings in at IBM data consulting services. We believe we have all the ingredients to make that happen. So Are you ready to take your data engineering to the next level? And IBM, we are ready to help you bring transform your data engineering team practice for the better.",7.0

"Um much compendium IBM Consulting distinguished engineer in hybrid cloud federal organization for last seven years, I've been consulting IBM clients to modernize and migrate their application to cloud. Cloud adoption and migration are hot topics in the business world today. You may ask, why so much focus on cloud gardeners research predicts that over 95% businesses will use cloud computing by 2025. That's an incredibly rapid growth rate. As a solution architect, I work with our federal clients to understand their needs. And pain points. I assess, advise and create a road map to help the clients move their applications. Each client has its own journey and its own obstacle to overcome. There are a few factors to consider from the start while designing this solution. Unfortunately, moved to cloud is not as cost effective as clients expect. Building and designing a robust cloud foundation architecture is fundamental to ensure the success. Second is um following agile process and dev stack up soon, prove productivity and speed to delivery. Other nations critical as part of building cloud they've Cyclops and Agile delivery are critical part of every cloud journey. You may ask, So what happens after we migrate all these workloads to cloud? Sustainability and management of cloud is where? Ipm and me as an IBM representative shinzan reason why it is critical to design the cloud architecture correctly from beginning and then to be sure that automate everything and make everything as code automation is part of they built A1 and then continue today too and operation would lead you successfully build an environment and migrate to cloud. If you have any question please contact me and e-mail me. If you have any questions just reach out. There's no question that is small or not. Grant, thank you so much for listening.",7.0

Certainly big data and artificial intelligence, which I am the chief Technology officer and the data and technology transformation unit. So that's for the start in this introduction or I'm looking forward to tell you more in a few moments and that's it for now. Thanks a lot for your attention. So some will sound check. How about this?

"If you claim that AI is just the hype. And I think that's a good sign because it means that we are beyond this hype of inflated expectations and we're going down the hill. Well, hard realities kicking. That's now the phase where maybe some people want to stop everything. But the interesting thing here is now to sort out reality. So what I would like to do is talk briefly about some myths, let's call it, and some realities in, eh, I on the end of 23, let's see how far we get. So number one is around this fear that. Eh, I might kill humanity. And let me rephrase that. The question could be, will eh, I outperform man? And the answer is a clear yes, and it already does so in some respect and in some domains. So where exactly is that happening? AI is about making decisions, in a large sense. If it's detecting stuff, if it's recognizing stuff, etc. So decisions. And if you think about decision making, there's this famous Donald Rumsfeld matrix. With four quadrants, and one of these is the known knowns, which means basically you know about certain stuff and you have the facts together and basically you could think that this one piece of the four different quadrants is there may be, eh, I could help. If you have the data, which means you know what data to look for, and if the data is sufficient in quality and quantity, then maybe I might help. But forget about all the rest and there's so much more important things that we humans need to make decisions on. So secondly, can we trust this kind of AI and decision making and the 3rd that I might touch on if I manage time better will be? What about ethics and? What do we do about it? So that's my pitch once it should be optimized and I'm really amazed how fast 2 minutes can go. Bye. Thanks a lot for listening union again. Bye for now.",5.0

"Hi, good evening everybody. I'm bouta happy. I'm will be talking about Xena Box. So what is Xena box? I'm sure you at least wonder what disease stands for. It is the Z for IBM system Z mainframes. So the box is the system that allows us to run a future. Mainframe system, before we actually build it and we will use hardware emulation for it. Especially what we're worried about is the heart of the system, which is the microprocessor. So I'm sure everybody has laptops and smartphones. They all have microprocessors in it. In our case, our IBM Z microprocessors is performing transactions whenever, for example, somebody pays with his credit card. And we also want to do it with a performance that we're expecting, for example, when we stand at a cashier at Starbucks and verify that. All that before we manufacture the chips. So just to give you a perspective, tell them our newest microprocessor is this big, right? It contains 11 billion transistors and 19 miles of wires, and they're just this big. So manufacturing prototypes cuts millions and having a fatal bug in their costs millions. And also it takes multiple months until we receive hot over the fix in order to avoid this will add hardware emulation. To our development of future microprocessors. So this is typically special hardware that allows us to run a different programmable representation of the hardware. So will represent major parts of our microprocessor in the emulation system, means we put Z in a box. And with hardware emulation will also be able to connect to real components. So we can just put it into a real new microprocessor and the hardware emulation system into a new system.",6.0

"Hi, Gartner estimates that in 2022, about four and a half trillion dollars worldwide will be spent on global it. But only about 1/10 of that, a little over 450 million billion dollars, will be spent to support the IBM sorry story. Hi. In 2022, Gartner estimates that about four and a half trillion dollars will be spent on global it, but only about 1/10 of that $500 billion will be spent on the cloud. Why is that? I mean, after all, for over a decade now, cloud has been hyped as the place to run your business is. Well, one reason for that is that most clouds are designed for what's called cloud native applications, applications that were built specifically to take advantage of cloud features. And that's how they get their performance and security and resilience and what have you. And if you've got something that else, well, you need to re platform it. This cloud platform, so if you're the CIO or IT director of a successful health care company or bank or retailer or manufacturer, you've now spent probably years if not decades and millions if not billions of dollars building the infrastructure that runs your business successfully with all the security and operational requirements and compliance that you need. And you're being told that you need to re platform to rebuild it if you want to take advantage of these now cloud features. That would be like saying, hey, somebody like me, it's got a 40 year old house, but they generally like, it's got great strong bones, it's got a view they love, it's a neighborhood they like. It's got pictures of their kids and saying, well, if you want to get the new features, the new entertainment center or what have you that you can get in these new houses that were built by your friends or built by friends and a new development, you need to tear it down and rebuild it from scratch. And that makes no sense. And that's why the IBM cloud takes a different approach. We're focused on hybrid cloud and AI infused with a strong focus on building the automation for compliance and security that our enterprise customers needs. 'cause we understand the enterprise. So if you're that director is CIO, you can take your legacy mainframe or power systems or what have you already works with Oracle or uh or. Running our cloud or don't leave it where it is now, that's the beauty of hybrid cloud. You can run it. You can run your workloads in the cloud or other cloud and we can make it work and you can modernize this core infrastructure that you like and continue to use it and add the new features. Like, so it's been like saying I want to take my house and I'm going to keep the pictures. I'm going to keep the rate for, Umm, keep that silly pineapple lamp, but I'm going to replace the carpeting that's working out and we replace the appliances and therefore get the right solution in a way that makes more sense. Um, essentially, why should you tear down what works for the sledgehammer instead of just remodeling when you've got that? It's a bit of finishing.",6.0

"Hello, folks. Today I wanted to talk about something that's very dear and near and dear to me. Uh, what we're seeing is that businesses are accelerating their digital transformation initiatives and their application modernization initiatives. And this is driven to a large extent by demographic changes by COVID. What what really grabbed my attention was not that this transformation is happening, but a statistic that was reported by many analysts that conservatively 40% of projects do not completely realize their transformation goals. And a root cause that was identified by these studies was that in many cases the business goals and the technical goals were not aligned and the transformation approaches failed as a consequence. So what needs to be done to improve the success rate? How do we transform more efficiently and cost effectively and how do we do that while providing business is the value that they expect and they desire? At IBM, we are creating a new approach. It's called an approach driven by archetypes. Effectively, an archetype is a way to codify how to align business initiatives with the value they provide and create opinionated technical capabilities that will help realize these in a cost effective way. So effectively, an archetype communicates a value that the transformation provides to the business the primary aspects that need to be brought together to realize this value, and an integrated view of the technologies, best practices, and accelerators that will produce successful outcomes. IBM has created a set of these or set of archetypes, nine of these, and they span both digital or technical transformation from a digital perspective as well as business transformation like how do you start implementing a leap to cash process. And we've applied these archetypes to very, very large engagement and large transformations. We've applied it at global scale. And yes, we have successfully disproven the fact that 40% of transformation projects fail not on our watch.",6.0
"Hello, nice to meet you today. So 25 years ago I actually started my career in the world of supply chain, which is amazing that a lot of people just became aware of what supply chain management is. And actually it started when I was a freshman in college. I started off in engineering at Michigan State University and then decided after the fall semester that engineering really wasn't for me and I moved over to supply chain management. Then during my sophomore year of college after the semester ended, I applied for internships and I ended up. Working for Nabisco and I loved the world of supply chain and I knew then that I wanted to become a Chief Operating Officer later in my career. Yes, it's hard to believe that at the mere age of 20 I had the aspirations of becoming a Chief Operating Officer. And four years ago I actually achieved that role at a prior company and I've now been with Brooklyn and for the last 10 months in same roles, the Chief Operating Officer. So amazing that I had the vision long time ago and I was able to achieve it, um, essentially throughout all the career. Working in the world supply chain, growing my skills and really, um, mentoring and developing others and continuously learning of how this interconnected world worked, how we develop and move products across the globe and we actually create a great amazing customer experience. Um, so it's one of those things. I think it's having vision, dry, believing in yourself, continuous learning to be able to end up where you want to be in your career. And I know that. It's hard to imagine that at the age of 20, like I said before that I had that vision, but it was something throughout my entire career I wanted to achieve and I'm happy that I was able to get the opportunity to achieve that and continues to grow and learn and now give back to others, um, since I've been able to achieve this role throughout my career. So thank you for spending time with me today to learn about how I ended up where I am today, and I'm wishing you the best along your journey.",2.0
"Today I'm going to teach you about making my favorite dish, which is chicken marsala. So the first thing you need to do is buy the ingredients to make this dish. That would be chicken, lemons, mushrooms, so Marcello wine, garlic, egg, noodles, and bread crumbs. Make sure you have eggs and milk as well at home. And olive oil. So the first thing you're going to do is you're going to get thin sliced chicken. If not, you need to get the chicken and make it super thin. Then you're going to make. An egg batter and coat the chicken and then put bread crumbs on it and then you're going to heat some olive oil and saute the chicken and then you're going to add the sliced mushrooms. I prefer to use the Porta Bella mushrooms that are super yummy and then you're going to add lemon slices over on top of the chicken and forgot earlier gonna add the garlic and then you're going to add the Marsala cooking wine and you were going to let it saute simmer with the lid on it. 5 or 6 minutes at the same time, you're going to boil water and cook your egg noodles. And once it gets to a boil, then you want to turn it down to simmer for about 5 minutes, as I said. And once your egg noodles are cooked, you're going to drain them and then place the chicken marcella on top of the egg noodles. It's super yummy, easy to make, and it's a dish that everybody will love, um, whether it's their first time having it or their 50th time having it. So hopefully you enjoy it as much as I do.

So imagine this. You're sitting down with a perspective customer. All the stakeholders run the room. You got an opportunity or business problem you're trying to address, and you've just delivered a stellar technical briefing followed by captivating demo. Everybody in the room was super engaged. Lots of questions, features about all the different features and you had all the right answers. Everybody in the room knows this problem can solve or this solution can solve the problem your client is trying to address. And then the questions change. They change from features to questions about regulatory requirements. Vulnerability scans, encryption standards, multifactor authentication, fisma Fedramp, DoD impact levels. The gaps are too many.

"So you are or you've been through massive digital transformation of your business lately? Have you heard about application resource management? To provide compelling digital services without overspending on your infrastructure or on your cloud build. Hi, my name is Frank Boudin, eh. I'm from IBM client engineering and let me quickly explain you why in many modern businesses are actually embracing application resource management. Er, emm. Let's first use an analogy from the retail industry, the supply chain of retailer. On one side, you've got the consumers buying products, your application. We need resources. On the other end you've got the suppliers shipping products to the Italians warehouses. And retailers are always constantly optimizing their supply chain, making sure they don't buy too many products from suppliers, filling up their warehouse, and sometimes ending up throwing away some products they don't sell on the other end trying to avoid. Porta shortage in some of the stores because any heaters know that if you don't act product on the shelf then you're going to miss some sets. That's what application resource management is all about, trying to optimize the supply chain of resources to your application so that they perform great and they provide compelling digital services but you not overspending. On your cloud bit and on the other end, you still have enough, because if you don't, you may have end user issues. And guess what? If this is your Commerce website, you're going to end up missing cells. So not only now you can benefit from this great IBM technology, but we also have with the IBM cloud engineering away for you and your team to experience it in your environment to optimize the value for your business.

And I was able to apply for a job that made sense and aligned with my career history, working for the state of Utah and applied for that job and then actually received the job. So I've been with work day for about five years, started out as a deployment manager, which is a lower level engagement manager role. Working on just small projects and two years after starting that job. I moved into an engagement manager role where I have now been for the last three years. It's a lot of fun, it's fast pace, and I really enjoy spending time working with customers as well as fellow work day employees supporting them during these rapid software implementation projects. I feel like it fits with my personality and aligns with kind of the type of work that I enjoy to doing, which is with people, as well as solving problems and tackling issues as they come up unexpectedly. So that's how I got to work day and in my role as an engagement manager. Thanks for your time.",4.0
"Good afternoon. Today I'm going to be teaching you how to make vegan gluten free pancakes. Yes, vegan gluten free. I know they don't sound very good, but I promise you they are delicious. Make them for my kids all the time and they eat them all. There's never any leftovers so quickly. Ingredients are one to one gluten free flour. Bobs Red mill is my favorite brand. One ripe banana. Chia seeds. Yeah, tablespoon or two of those, some vanilla. I like to use the powdered vanilla beans, but you can also use vanilla extract. Just a tablespoon or so of that and some cinnamon sprinkled it in as much as you like. Right, you put everything in one bowl except for the banana on. The final magic ingredient is the oat milk. You have to use oat milk. I promise you, it's worth it. 1 cup of that. Put the banana in a small bowl, mash it up good so it's really goopy, really really goopy, and then fold that into all of the dry ingredients as well as the vanilla. If you decide to use the extract, you can put that in the wet ingredients, so fold that into the dry ingredients and at the end you add the oat milk. Mix it up. Depending on the consistency you can add extra water to make it. A little bit more thinned out, but that's up to you if you like. Uh, really fluffy thick pancake, you can decide. That is how you make vegan gluten free delicious pancakes. Enjoy.",5.0
"In Salt Lake City, UT. Hello, my name is Noah Zemke. I'm 37 years old and I live in Salt Lake City, UT. I'm going to tell you about my role as an engagement manager. So I work for work day. It's a software company I don't know how to code. I know how to do anything like that. So I help manage people and processes during their software implementations that customers go through. Essentially, think of it as a general contractor for a home construction build project. I don't do that. I'll work, I don't do the plumbing. I just schedule all those things. I connect with all of the subcontractors and the key resources and make sure that the work is getting done. I meet with a customer, make sure they're happy, make sure that the things they have to do or getting done, answer any questions they have and so forth and so on. And so that's what I do is an engagement managers. I project managed software implementations. Thanks.",5.0

"Hello. As I've mentioned, I worked for work day. I've been with the company for about five years and candidly I couldn't be happier. Um asked to share what's going well and what could be better. I guess I would say the number one thing that I love about working with Work day is the work life balance. I love my work. It's challenging, I get great support, but I also get time away from work on the weekends, the evenings obviously, and also just flex schedule as I need for family events. On vacations and anything else. So really enjoy that. If I had to pick something that could be improved, honestly, I think I would just say more money. I love money because I have a family and I like to support them, and who doesn't want to get paid more? So I would always be welcome to taking on a higher paycheck, but really, that's pretty minimal. I'm happy with everything here.",4.0

"Hello I started at GE in my my last Co-op was in fan and booster in the pack when that still existed working legacy commercial engines and from there from fielded engines. I started working backwards in the engine lifecycle so I moved from there to my. Passport 20 certification role in Pack, fan and booster for my first Edison Roll, then for the next two Edison rolls. I worked on a military development program, so somewhere between PDR and DDR well in advance of certification in flight in the field and there I had a much bigger design space and again got an appreciation for how much I enjoyed problem solving and throwing some creativity into my designs. From there I rolled off program and then followed a colleague to preliminary design, which gave me even more opportunity to be creative as I'm working with paper engines, things that may be out in the field in five or 15 years or something in between. And then after having that experience, I was contacted by some of my old colleagues from my passport 20 days and they said, hey, we have a role for you that you might like. You're really good at these big wide open creative problems and thought this might be up your alley. And I agreed with them. And so I followed them to my current role, which is in a development military program. So I get. A smaller design space than I had. Um, preliminary design. But I still have enough that I can be creative and I can get into the nitty gritty design space, which is really kind of a sweet spot of where I want to be.",5.0
"Hello I'm going to teach you how to make my favorite lunch that I have every week quinoa hash or I have a variety of it every week. So I tend to make my quinoa hash using an instant pot. It is extremely convenient so pressure cooker and it makes cooking this significantly easier. I highly recommend getting one. First what you do is you take your quinoa. I use about a cup and 1/2, so about 1/4 cup per day for six servings. And I put that in, I rinse it first to get some of the shell off, make it less bitter, and then throw it in the instant pot. I take about a 12 ounce can of chicken broth to give the quinoa little extra flavor 'cause. It'll tend to take whatever flavor that is cooked in when it's cooked. Take that 12 ounce can of chicken broth. Throw that in the pot, then add your carrots, some chopped onion, maybe throw in. I tend to open up a can of corn or black beans. Drain them, rinse the beans, throw those both in the instant pot, and then add your protein to the pot. So maybe that's chicken that all saute and make fully white on the outside before I throw in. Maybe some ground beef, maybe, and these are my favorites to use. Either. I could kill bossa Oren and Dewey sausage to add a little kick, a little bit of spice. Anything else that you'd want to throw into the instant pot that won't get crushed too much under the pressure? That's important. Date that, throw that all in their seal it up. Cook for three minutes on high pressure while that's pressurizing and cooking. Cut up your Peppers, cut up your zucchini, cut up your tomatoes, cut up your jalapenos, whatever else you'd like to add in. Once your pressure cooker is done, throw all of those extras into the pot, mix it up, and you're done for the week, for lunch. Congratulations.",4.0
"For some reason I'm going to talk about my previous role rather than my current, but I worked in preliminary design, which means I worked in paper engines where I own the entire T of the engine design, the entire cross section, unlike other roles where I may have owned one or two pieces of hardware and. I was responsible for the wait for how everything went together initially and the initial design, the aerodynamic design of the flow path. And the the mechanical design of the different hardware pieces that are that make up that flow path.

"So I'll again describe my previous workplace. The workplace I worked in, Pryor was a relatively typical office space with files of quads of four where the two sides of the aisles of quads of four, excuse me, were tall 6 ish foot cube walls and separating those squads of four within those aisles where maybe 4 foot walls that were high enough to divide those quads. But low enough that you could still put your head over your monitor and look at your neighbor across the wall. One thing I loved about that space is that you could collaborate very well. It was very well lit my it was very well climate controlled. However, on the downside I did not have any windows next to my space, which was annoying.

With one coverage model from one service provider, which for many of our clients is a compelling way of moving forward. So from a reporting from a technology, from a client coverage, from a networking perspective, that gives you the confidence of dealing with one party for all of your products, which means that you can concentrate on your business and you don't have to worry about navigating the spiders web.

"Hi, Lisa. I think one of the most interesting things that we have to deal with in relation to the client side is our coverage model and how we as a group allow you the ability to be able to navigate through the organization. I've just explained in my my last conversation how we break ourselves into various different segments. Not only is that segment, for example, I take asset servicing split into asset owners, banks, broker dealers, alternative investment services. We also have markets divisions, corporate trust divisions, etc. In order to navigate that system and we have a quite compelling coverage model. We have relationship management at the top supported by senior management. We have a client service delivery team who are a form of day-to-day operational excellence and form of escalation and the underlying operational heads which allows our clients through our history of knowledge of their businesses to be able to navigate being wires and organization.",5.0
"Hey, John. Hope all is well, um, Tom here. Um, quick conversation today and hopefully should be quite an easy one. We're looking to expand holiday at the moment in relation to the underlying employees working within the bank. And I feel it's compelling conversation following where we've been in the light of the last two years and the COVID environment that we've all suffered the majority of the team. And certainly this is from an Amir perspective, but I imagine it's a global perspective as well. I haven't spoken with the various different groups are suggesting that their teams are logging on at 8:00 in the morning. Finishing at 8:00 o'clock in the evening and you know they're very concerned about the well-being of the team. We've seen huge amounts of redundancies. We've seen huge amounts of people looking to leave the organization and for periods of time, whether that be to take sabbaticals, whether they're going out on 6 sick leave. So my view is that we need to ensure that our staff are well looked after, we promote within the context of well-being and happiness on are. My source page is how we as an organization are very candidly dealing with uh with forms of mental illness. And with the well-being of our staff and I feel it appropriate that we matched that, um. Our ability to deliver their to what we're doing in practice. I can cite many of my team who are saying that whilst they loved working within the organization culturally, they now need to have the ability or the confidence to say that they can turn the computer off and take more time away. We know that we're heavily resource constrained at the moment and I feel that the only way that we're going to get through the post kovid. For this foreseeable future is to allow our staff to recharge their batteries and move away. Now it may well be. That we say to the guys that works, that works well and if you're away somewhere in a foreign holiday or foreign destination, we might need you to log in for a period of time that maybe for a week, for a couple of days out of the week you work. But we'll have to see how that works.",6.0
"Hey, it's Tom again. Just looking to pick up on where we left off in relation to the to the previous conversation around UM, holiday and sick pay. Um, my view is that our conversation was constructive. My view is that if we straw poll our clients, we have a look at pecan surveys. This is something that really, really will assist with us keeping our staff, keeping our staff motivated. And making them also advocates of the culture of BNY Mellon. And from a marketplace perspective, I think this is this would be hugely well received. Um, I don't think there's two really much more to add on the back of that because I feel positive inasmuch as if we offer this to our teams, we're going to see accelerated performance and we're going to have a happy motivated work stuff. So if we could have a direct definitive decision on this and we can move forward, I think therefore we we're going to see the benefits of this and will be well rewarded.",3.0
"Good afternoon everyone. Thank you very much for being here. For those of you who don't know me, my name is febreeze bad. I've been at work there for about 8 years and my role is to consult with customers to help plan, architect, develop and test integrations between work day and 3rd party information systems. Today, I'll share with you what a typical day looks like for me. What's excited about what I do. I typically start my morning by looking at my calendar and determining which task I will need to prioritize. I focus first on live meetings with customers or vendors that I draw my attention to, development activities or which tend to require more focus and concentration. When I leave meetings with customers or vendors, I draw the audience attention towards what we try to accomplish. And paid a contextual picture. I identify each stakeholders and engage them to share information or artifacts that will help move the conversation. Often their audience is communication based. Terms we use here at work there may be unfamiliar. To the audience. Similarly, vendors or customers or like have their own nomenclature. When I develop integrations, I gather documents, file samples and meeting notes to design the pattern. What does the integration?",5.0

I'll teach you about how to grow succulents indoors. Succulents, for those of you who don't know how beautiful, tough plants that thrive in almost any conditions. They require very little maintenance, and once they're established, you can enjoy them for years to come. Here I'll share 5 easy steps on how to obtain beautiful looking plants to enhance an indoor room. First you need to pick up the right spot. That means selecting apart with good drainage to prevent excess moisture. Excess moisture will do actually rot the roots 2. Use the correct growing medium. You want to use a blend of potting soil that contain course materials such as sand. Three uh, give them lots of indirect sunlight. You want to make sure that they get at least six hours of indirect sunlight each day. You want to avoid direct sunlight as you tend to scorch their leaves. Step 4. Switch locations frequently. If you fail to rotate them, they tend to grow unevenly. Give them 1/4 turn every few weeks to promote even growth. Five, what are the soil, not the plant? Too much moisture around the stems or on their lives will quickly lead to mold. So follow those five easy steps and you'll have gorgeous plants in no time. Thank you.",4.0

I've been in the aviation business for more than 35 years. So I've worked on many programs.

So that's the rule I had presently. And. You know it. It meets my own personal aspirations, but also I think given my background, it's where I bring the most value to the business. So. Um.

Some of these sort of show what it is that they that they want or they need. So the way it works is then is if you're going to buy a gift for somebody or give a gift you go to. List you find what they want. Now the individual who's the owner of the list, there's not no who's purchasing gifts or if somebody purchased or not, that's that's kept anonymous from that person.

Um, initially I started in software engineering when Coop computers were programmed with paper tape. Um, at the time I thought this was great because these computers lived in great big air conditioned rooms and I thought, fantastic are gonna get into some big engineering. Unfortunately, not too long after that time, computers became much smaller. So, um, I still enjoyed software engineering and my first major project came along and I was able to lead the software engineering team on uh, uh, better software that's developing anti vibration technology for a helicopter, specifically the EH1UH-1 helicopter. Um, it was certified both civilly and in military aerospace. So that was that was good fun and good exposure. Following on from that, I got the opportunity to work as a project engineer now. Project Engineering was helping me understand other engineering disciplines and get more involved in the whole project structure and how everything works, and I really enjoyed that aspect. That clearly led on to more of a career path and I went into general management. However, in general management I missed the cut and thrust of the projects as you. Driving through projects and all the challenges that projects begin and have going forward. So from that point onwards, I knew that I wanted to do was to lead development projects and hence that is how I got into project management. I think that's the end of my 2 minutes talk.

"Hello again. Um. I'm going to be very foolish and try and do a 2 minute teach on three ball juggling. Now this could be a disaster. So OK, we're going to start off on three ball juggling. And the best way, I mean here's three ball juggling while we're trying to get to um, but the best way to get going on this is to start with one ball juggling, which hey, that's easy. So one ball juggling throwing from one hand to the other hand. I lacrosse. That's fairly simple, intern. Then you start getting onto 2 ball juggling, so you're throwing one up and then the other one, so it's still across, and then you want to swap back. So start with the left hand, then the right hand, left hand. Right hand, so you've got a sensually the the overall structure of what you want to try and get to with a 3 ball juggle. Now 3 ball juggling is much harder because you're trying to keep a ball in the air at all times whilst you're 3 ball juggling. But the best way to start is to start with just one sequence, so you just going up or um over and catch and just one sequence. So essentially that if you saw it and I'll do a repeat. So that's three ball juggling in a very simplistic way. Now you want to try and get into continuing that sequence. So it's a continuous sequence of trying to keep the ball in the air. And I say this is very risky because I haven't done this for sometime, so trying to keep it going and I'll try and do a number of sequence here.

Um, that was the problem that we are facing now. What was expected that point, the value that should have been sent on the file was expected because it was a mandatory field. Because that that is the value that was used in order to decide whether a worker is qualified for a benefit plan or the worker won't be qualified for a benefit plan. The people who all were involved in making the final decisions where their customers, their vendors, the developers and the project managers. We all went in together in order to make sure that we tackle the problem together to give the perfect product to the customer, ran to the client. The outcome was we all worked very hard. We all collaborated with each other. The functional team, they set up the configuration that was required for us to make that happen and the developers went in and we all made it happen.

"Hi, I'm doing a T I'm doing my teaching video and I've picked up the topic is how to make my favorite food. So before you even, um do do this, I just want to say the food that I will be preparing is a lentil Stew. Um, because that's one of the most easiest recipe that you can go to. It's very nutritious. It's tasty. Basically all your family members will love it. So the first step in order to do anything is plan. Always. Plan now the items that you need to make, whether you have all the produce in hand, whether you have all the utensils and hand, how you will be cooking it, what you will be eating in with, all that thing you need to plan because that decides whether you want to go with this recipe or not. The second step that you want to do is collect the items. In order to make lentils to you need, you need a little. Basically you can go with any little, you need money and you need tomato, you need some spices, basically cumin. Red chili, turmeric and salt and then you need oil and then and then you go to the Step 3 which is basically how you cook lentils. In order to do that you basically will heat your pan, put in the oil splitter, the cumin seeds, then sought here onions, garlic and ginger. Then put in your tomatoes. Once that is done you will need to add some water. Usually I have it proportions of tourists to one. So if I'm taking One Cup of lentil I'll put 2 cups of water and then. Once that is done, I'll add my soul based on what taste I like and then I'll put in my lentil. I'll close the lid and I'll let it simmer and let it cook. In this team. Don't try to rush it. Let it cook slowly because that's where it had all the flavors. And once you're done well. Ah, you have a very good lentil soup which is tasty, delicious. You can share it with your family and enjoy it in your family time. Thank you.",3.0

Giving up, it's actually not that much, because, um, for, to your surprise, 75,000 steps is equal into 5 miles. Um.

"Hello, my name is Robert Donovan McBride. I go by Donovan. Um, 38 years old and I'll tell you a little bit about how I got started in my career. I was young, probably 20, and I was working at retail, at hardware store and. I have a pretty good knowledge of mechanical things and how they worked my dad, but I didn't know the intricacies of machining and engineering I was really interested in. Making breakthroughs and bicycles and and a lot of things mechanical I could see improving so my buddy told me about machining. Eh signed myself up for a Community College class and from there it kind of blossomed. I'd started understanding machining and and processes. I got a job as a machinist. I advanced my career and went from a machinist to a tech. Um, from a tech to uhhh entry level engineer, entry level engineer, and various companies along the way to where I am. Now, um, I'll back up a little bit. I even taught machining for a little bit then. Most really fun part of my career. But um, yeah. I am eh fancy manufacturing engineer or product order at GE Aviation right now. And we deal with the turbine blades, and it's probably some of the most advanced stuff I've ever done. Pretty challenging, interesting, and rewarding at the same time. Um, that is how I became. To where I am right now in my career. Right. Thank you so much.",3.0
"Hello, my name is darling. I'll be teaching you how to um. Take the steps to learn how to backflip a bicycle. First off, you're going to have to have have access to a foam pit. I would recommend this. I would not recommend doing it without a foam pit. Just 'cause the risk of injury. First thing you're going to want to do is practice jumping into the foam pit. And you have to get comfortable with this first. So normally involves 1/4 pipe, a big box and lots of foam inside that box. So you'll go up and land in the phone. We have to get comfortable with this first in order to be able to successfully start to back flow. Once you get comfortable with that, the next thing you're going to want to do is adjust how your body is in error. And you do this by your head, in your eye movements, whatever, whenever I and. Your neck and your head does. Your body is going to do so. You start to adjust how your pitches in air. Once you become comfortable with that, you can start letting your your rotation slow down. Your body naturally wants to correct you to make you up right, so if you get comfortable with going upside down, so start landing on your back in the phone. Once you've started landing in your back on the phone, the next thing is just commitment and putting your knees when you're on your bike and in the air. When you pull up where your shoulders are. So once you've done that and you've got that, you'll start letting upside down and the next thing is looking and spotting with your eyes. So pull back spot with your eyes and you'll start. Just fill your rotation, come around and you might not get all the way, but the next thing from there is tucking. So coupling your knees to your chest and looking and pulling around and eventually you will get all the way around with a little bit more speed every time. Alright, thanks.",5.0

Makes it hard to accomplish things without being interfered upon with other people and. What I mean by that it if you're working on something without communication, somebody may have already taken care of it. Or if you don't communicate that you've taken care of something, ah, there could be other people could be doing the same work twice.

"Hi, my name is Catherine Tyner and today I'm going to tell you about how I got into my current career. So I've been at GE Aviation for about three years now. I started just before COVID, um, so it's been definitely a challenge. But back in high school my dad was a electrical engineer and I always kind of knew based on interactions with him and how I went, how I wanted to grow up and get raised. So I took some engineering classes in high school and from there I decided. I wanted to become a mechanical engineer, so after getting the scholarship to my chosen university, I decided to go to Oklahoma State University to study mechanical engineering. While there, I ended up taking a variety of different classes, and one of the classes that I took was called material Science intro to material science. From there I decided that I had a very, very huge passion for material science, and from there I decided to pursue a higher education in material science. So I decided to go to the University of. Arkansas to pursue material science. Once there I got a masters in material science and I completed all of the processes and steps need to do so, and I got an offer from GE to start the day that I had to defend my my thesis. So from there I decided to join GIS Department of EMS, which is engineering and material science. And then after EMS I decided to go onto materials behavior where I am currently working on creating and designing different parts and seen after those parts are made, how to break them and have them with them.",4.0
"Hi, my name is Kathryn Tanner and I'm going to teach you how to play my favorite board game today, which is called Avalon. Avalon is a King Arthur Twist spin off of the game resistance. In the game you have two different factions warring against each other. You have the minions of Mordred, which is considered the evil faction, and you have the Knights of the Round Table which is considered the good faction. In this game you have three different missions you go on where each mission is composed of different people. Playing the board game, depending on who goes on the mission and what faction there on the missions can potentially fail or succeed. Each team is trying to get three out of the five to either succeed if they're on the good side or fail if they're on the bad side. So at the beginning of each game you choose a certain number to go, people to go on the mission. This number is determined by the game board. For example, in the first round, generally 2 people go on the mission. Whoever is the person to choose who goes on the mission this turn will then pick generally themselves and one other person making up to. After that, the group votes on whether they think these people are trustworthy. If the majority decides that these people are trustworthy, then they get to go on the mission. Once there, they get to either succeed the mission or failed the mission. The good guys always have to succeed the missions where the bad guys can choose to either fail or succeed to. To try to blend in. Once the mission is revealed, whether it passes or fails, it goes to that specific team. From there, people have to deduce who they think is good and who they think is bad until the very end of the game where one team becomes victorious.",6.0

"So on average a person takes a 7500 steps today. 7500 steps is kind of like going around the football field 62 times.

"Today you're going to learn. Um. How to play a pickup game of basketball. So before we get started, we talk about the things that are required. First of all, you're going to need a basketball, at least one basketball hoop with the backboard and at least two people to play. Now pick up basketball games can be played half court or a full court. Um, would definitely not recommend playing full court. If you have a team of only four people, two on two or one-on-one, that'll be a lot of running just for a couple of people. So typically one-on-one or two on two, play half Court 3, maybe. Still can do half court. It definitely four and five. You would obviously want to play full court with two goals, one on each side. Um, essentially you establish rules right from the beginning and you can pretty much. Create or, you know established any type of rules that you want. For example, you could set the game to end when the first team gets to 10 points, 12 points, 15 points, whatever that is. You could establish whether or not if there's a 3 point marker on the court, you could establish whether or not 3 point shots, or going to count towards two points um. Or if you're just going to have all shots count as one points. Typically in a game we pick up basketball, each bucket is worth one point. Um. But like I said, if you have the luxury of having a 3.9 painted on the court, you might be able to use that and and those would count for two. So essentially, you pick teams. There's a couple of different ways of picking teams, especially you get two people. If it's a 2 on 2, you get 2 on one side to another on the other side. You stab lish. What the? What your? You know what the when the game ends by establishing what points you're getting too, and then you basic normal rules of basketball. No double dribble, no fouls. I'm traveling. If you shoot the ball, if you're playing half court, you shoot the ball. There's typically a rule where you have to take it back behind the certain. You have to take the ball back a certain distance to be able to shoot again. If you're on the opposing team, get grabbing a rebound. Um. At the end of the day, it's your following basic basketball rules, except for the fact that there's no referee. You're calling your own shots and you calling your own faults files during during that time. Alright, thanks.",5.0

"Hi everyone, my name is Laurie Henry. I am a director here at work day looking after the Lunch Express program. How did I end up at work day? Good question. I've completely back student did not plan this at all. I worked for a very small company in Canada, Software Company. They asked me if I would move to the states which I did on the promise that they would get me a green card and we'll try to move to Philadelphia. With the company for about a year and a really small company, about 20 people. And I spent my time, I spent a lot of my time arguing viciously with the CEO about various things. We just like to argue. And one day I remember being in a room with them and a bunch of people, and he said, hey, we're a software company, but we need to be. And we basically made our money on services. So the number of amount of money you made was based on the number of people who work for your company, right? And he said we need to be like a software company. We need to be like a company, like work day, for example. And I was like, I've never even heard of. OK, so I kind of Google them and I know it's in my Google search history. Log into LinkedIn one day and it says, hey would you like a job at work today? And this was this was like completely random event for me. I clicked on the button, I applied for the job literally 4 weeks later I was working with them. Of your process was pretty interesting. It was basically me. I'm arguing, standing in front of a room with people, arguing with an Irish gentleman for about 30 minutes about whether the project was going well or not, and I came and left the interview thinking I probably haven't done a great job here, but they hired me anyway and I've been with the company for eight years now and enjoyed pretty much all of it. Yeah, I think it's fair to say. And yeah, I I think I I just wish I'd done it 10 years ago, to be honest with you. You know, I could have my life over again. I would join them much, much earlier.

I don't you come up bread or biscuit. I don't know this guy, that real thing. Um, but you would have it traditionally with, um, roast beef, lots of gravy. Um, so Sunday lunch type of deal right now, if you look on the Internet, you'll find many, many recipes for your trip. Didn't involve a really just three ingredients, maybe 4 if you count salt. There's eggs, there's milk and there's flower. I know someone will tell you 5 eggs and you know he painted milk or 10 ounces of flour. These things all involved weighing things and measure and don't do any of that. The simplest thing to do is get 3 identical glasses. Pint glasses would be good. And what you do is you would crack, um, let's just say you're making six eggs. So crack 6 eggs into one glass and that would come up to a level in the glass, right? Then you would take your flower and you will put flour and a second glass and put it up to the same level as the eggs. And in the third glass, you get the idea here guys. I felt glass fill it up with milk, same level as the eggs and the flower. Then you gotta do put them all in a bowl, mix them up to have gotten next batter, put some salt and taste it, and then leave it in the fridge for maybe 100 and 1/2 an hour. And meanwhile while you're doing that, eh, what you gotta do is you gotta turn your oven on. It's hot as it will go. Get a baking dish and put oil in the bottom of that. Stick that in the oven. Until it is smoking hot. Like smoking hot um, then once you're ready to go. Take your trade with the oil. The oven quickly poured in your battle. You can make one big one, or you can make lots of little ones depending how you work, eh? Um, stick that in the oven and leave it. Set it and forget it. Essentially. Leave it for about, I don't know, maybe 20 minutes. That's what will happen is it will rise up, fluff up and it will go lovely. Kind of a golden brown color. Then you gotta take out the oven, eat it as quickly as possible. Actually, you can eat it the next day even if you like 'cause. It's really good with jam. But but the real goal here is to make Sunday lines, so. Eat it as soon as it comes out the oven. OK, cool. Good luck with that by the way. Let me know how you get on.",6.0

"So here's an interesting statistic that I held had actually, I literally heard this an hour ago. So it's very, very fresh, right. And someone really this quote, which was that 1/3 of meetings that take place are a waste of time, right? So literally you get no value out of spending any time doing them, right? So I was trying to think about, well, what does that mean for me? So I have the job, but I have a lot of meetings right on calls constantly. So see if I did like camp 5 meetings per day, which is not unusual. 5-5 days a week. So it's 25 meetings a week. Multiply that by by 50 and you're on. I don't know what their maths and that is, but it's well over 1000 so let's call it. But he's of, let's just call it 1000 for ease of calculation. So 1000 meetings a year and 1/3 of those are completely wasted. So that's 303 hundred hours a year wasted.

"Camera started. So hello everyone. I I want you to think back to when you were a child and kind of reflect on what you wanted to be when you grew up back then. Um. Can you guess what I wanted to be? I guarantee it wasn't an engagement manager or service delivery manager. I wanted to be an astronaut, to boldly go where no human had gone before, and to explore strange new worlds. I had no idea. What it would take to to be an astronaut and no one in my immediate circle could, could tell me interesting. Lee, posing the question to guidance counselors, just drew blank stares growing up by gorged myself on all sorts of space shows and or movies from Buck Rogers, Witcher reruns from back in the day before my time to start track, lost in Space 2001, Space Odyssey, Star Wars, and so on. Um. So when I joined the military, the closest thing I could actually find to a spaceship was a submarine. So I signed up and that was quite the experience. So somehow these um Manor background led me to a career in Aerospace project management and so smiles am I getting closer to being an astronaut. Well, Fast forward. I landed at work Day as a senior engagement manager initially, and then became a principle engagement manager a little little over seven years. Ago, and now the service delivery manager for launch Express. Um, looking back I can actually see parallels to my original career goal. I traded Buck Rogers for Chris Rogers, star track for Starbucks, and although I I do get lost in workspace, I get to zoom quite often and go to great altitudes. The whole journey has been quite an odyssey and I love it.",5.0
"However, when I recently had an inground pool installed and, um found that cleaning the pool over to summer and in the hot sun was was quite the effort and the perspiration running in my eyes, and I needed a solution. So I I actually found out that, uh, a straw hat and a bandana or a great pair to kind of allow you to work in the sun. And so with that, you know, firstly I had to learn how to tie a bandana, so I'm going to explain. To you how to do that? So the first aspect is preparation. Of course. I suggest you Prewashed abandoned to remove any residual die and maybe even press it if you're so inclined to kind of remove the wrinkles. Makes it a little easier to start. Um, then find a flat surface so that you can start the process. So you would lay the bandana flat. You would lay it such as in a diamond shape so that wanted it corners is pointing to you on it's pointing away from you. And then you would take the opposite corner and bring it over to. The corner that's facing you, hold them together and then spread or end or flatten the bandana. Then you would take that those two ends that are pointing to you and then make about a three quarter of an inch fold of the bandana and then continue those that fold pattern and a three quarter inch an inch approximately um with and then fold roughly about 8 to 9 times. In doing so, you end up with a pretty enlongated. Um, bandana that. Then you would then turn over and have the last, I would say the final folded side facing you such that you can then pick up the bandana, center it on your forehead, and then bring the two ends around back and tie it. So the whole process should end up like this with the folded in inside. Fitted on. Nicely, and then you can add your straw hat if you're so inclined.",7.0

It's it's essentially how far light can travel at the speed of 186,000 miles a second in a given year and it turns out to be approximately 6 trillion miles in in a year. Uh, and it's used to measure distances. In with that, there's something also called a parsec, which is like 3.26 light years, and these are vast distances.

After thinking about it overnight, he decided yeah, I do have a daughter who is looking for a job, but I don't know if I can recommend her. So after a couple nights lost sleep he actually did recommend that I go interview and take a part time job filling in for someone that was injured by being an accounting assistant for county government. Well, that turned into two years of filling in for someone that never came back. And five more years of having career development with this organization. After five years of working as an accounting assistant, the opportunity to become a budget analyst for the overall county Budget Office. After doing this for a couple years, then I turned into an opportunity to become a business analyst. This gave me the opportunity to put together my knowledge of finance and payroll and combine that with my interest in technology. So this gives me the opportunity part to participate in Y2K activities and.

"So you won't learn something new well. It was a few years back in 1997 to be exact, when I had the opportunity as a child to host a softball team from Taiwan. They spent a month with us, living at our house. We were carried them around, took them different places, and as a gesture of their appreciation, they chose to host a party and cook us a Taiwanese meal. From that point forward, I've always had an interest in. Chinese cooking. One of my favorites and something everyone asked him to make is wontons, so here's some instruction on how that goes. When you go to the store, grab some won ton wrappers, pork, ground ground beef, some green onions, go to your pantry, get some sesame oil and soy sauce. You'll need an egg and some oil for frying these tasty little Nuggets. We prefer soy sauce for dipping to go ahead and pick that up too. These are pretty simple. Fix the pork, the beef, the green onions, some soy sauce, oil, and egg together to make your filling. The egg will help it stick together. The pork and beef provide great moisture inside. Mix this up and get your wonton wrappers out. Be sure you keep a moist to put a wet paper towel over the top. As you get ready to fold them, I like to keep it simple. Take a teaspoon full or half a teaspoon full of your filling. Put it in the middle of your rapper. Use some water and noise in the edges so it acts like glue. Fold them corner to corner and create a triangle. Caelum up real good so nothing gets out and go on to the next one. Won't you have a small batch? Go ahead and fry them in some hot oil until they're bubbly and brown. Take him out, throw him on a paper towel and let him rest. I hope you enjoy them.

"So hello, so this is a throat video of how to use my favorite product. My favorite product that I would like to teach you how to use today is an acoustic guitar. Space is something that I played for around 10 years. Um, and it's a very it's Rangel experience. So in order to get started with playing the guitar. You would need to ascertain which hand you are. I'm sure that we pretty simple for most of you. Um, so for me, if you're left-handed, you would hold the body of bigger time with your left hand and use the neck of the car with your right hand. So the neck of the guitar is used for. Making notes for actually playing the melodies and then you have a sound hole in the body of the guitar, which is where your left hand where you would use a straw man action or a string picking action. So in order to make any kind of decent sound from your acoustic guitar, you would need to make sure that it is in tune. There are a number of different term tunings that you can use. There's a standard tuning that everybody uses. They would tune their notes from the thickest string at the top of the guitar down to the thinnest string which is eh sorry radd. And G. B&E so that standard tuning, that's what you use. Um, unless you were doing something like rock'n'roll where you may drop it down half a step and I have something called a drop D But standing is what we use for most things. So once you've got it in June, then you can start experimenting with where you place your fingers on the fret board, which is where the strings are moving across on the neck in your right or left hand. And pluck the strings that you have depressed onto the fret board to see which notes you get. Um, and move from there. Good luck.",4.0

All the architecture is still there. Everything was beautiful about the place in the 14th century is still there today. Loads to see. Most important factor if, like me, you enjoy a beer. Less than a pound. Less than a pound for a pint. You can't get better than that. The weather. Pretty similar to in the UK, so in the summer it's nice and warm.

"My current role is systems engineering, focal for a major airframer. I started, ah Gee, about 20 years ago, and fan and compressor or dynamics, and I was designing airfoils at that point in time. I really enjoyed that role. I met a lot of great people, I learned a lot and it was very challenging. But the thing I didn't necessarily like so much about that role as I didn't have a chance to interact with a very broad team and I had almost no customer exposure and I also really wanted to. Get more involved with the business side, Baby Asian. So I took advantage of the GI on site mycro gram and then I went and did a program management role where I had a lot more customer exposure and where I was able to really see a broader piece of the picture.

I did that for a couple of years, really broadened the team of folks.

"So one of the suggested topics here today was how to make your favorite food. I don't know if it's actually my favorite food, but one of my favorite foods to make is grilled chicken thighs. They're actually really simple to make their nothing fancy, but I really enjoy it 'cause, they're relatively easy, they taste great. It gives me a chance to spend some time outside and my kids will actually eat um, which is probably the most important part. So as with with any grilled food, I think one of the most important parts is making sure that it's seasoned well and then just simply cooked. Well, um, and I think also that the chicken thighs really have a really nice balance of, you know, being a MIDI cut, but having enough skin on them that they really have a lot of flavor. So the first thing I do is I start by brining, um, for at least at least four hours or so. So I make a saltwater brine with some brown sugar and a whole bunch of seasonings and justice, let him soak in that, which really helps to make it more tender, and they stay juicy, is what I found. Then after that's done, I take them out. iPad, um, dry. And put my favorite rub on EMM, but that but that's it for a few minutes while I Preheat the grill. Um, I want the girl to be nice and hot at least. At least 400 degrees hotter is better and get them on and just kind of serum on both sides to make sure all the juices stay in and they start to brown a little bit. But you can't leave him like that for too long otherwise they'll ultimately burn and that's no good. So then I turn the heat down low and then really it's my favorite part. You drill them indirectly, or at least on low so you don't have any flare ups. You you let him sit there and you enjoy your favorite beverage. Hopefully talk to somebody on your patio or deck for half an hour or so while I cooked through. Then when they're almost cooked all the way through, then I like to heat them up a little bit more. Turn off the grill plate EMM and they're ready to eat. So enjoy.",5.0

So they'll come to us and they'll say, hey, we need an engine for such and such an application. Uh, it needs to fly this high, this fast. Um, it needs to have this much thrust and we'll go through our stable of engines and will typically start by sending him some data so that they can go run a simulation on their aircraft.

"So my favorite vacation destination is to go run a cabin in the mountains someplace. I find it really relaxing. You can get away from everything, kind of. Be by yourself or with your family and whoever you wanted to spend time with. And it's really just an opportunity to get outside and enjoy nature a little bit. You can go hiking if you feel like it. You can stay home and sit in the hot tub if you'd rather do that. You can cook, you can go out to a restaurant, you can do whatever you like. But the most important thing is you're just getting away from everything. For a little while, and for me, I've never gotten sunburn going to vacation in the mountains, unlike if I'm forced to go to the beach. So I really like that. That's my preference and I highly recommend it to you.",

There are lots of buildings here where we do everything from engineering to engine test, two labs where we try out new materials. It's really a great place. There's a lot of history here. We even have a Learning Center where you can go and tour different, different engines from the past and learn about how the company got its start. So I find it a really great. Place to work that you can interact with people from all sorts of different disciplines. And in my particular area, the military side of the business, people have been here almost all the time through COVID and it's really great chance to work with all your coworkers. So I think that's really the best part of it is that chance to have face to face interaction every day and to collaborate, um, probably the one thing that could use a little improvement as the facilities are getting a little older, so they're constantly trying to refurbish EMM and hopefully they'll keep up the good work on that too.",5.0

"Hello, this is Eric Fitzpatrick. I would like to go over a little bit of how I wound up as an aerospace engineer at GE Aviation in their early years. My father was an Air Force pilot and we love going to air shows and I always wanted to be a pilot as well. And by the time I went to college I had a Air Force scholarship for electrical engineering. And with that scholarship, I had hoped to be a pilot. The pilot slots were unavailable, so I changed major to aerospace engineering 'cause. I loved aircraft and my favorite classes were always jet engines. So I was thinking I'd like to be at GE Aviation designing jet engines and just like. My mom had worked there back in the 50s. So moving on to the professional years, once I left college, I took a job designing blowers and fans with CFD, which is computational fluid dynamics, and then I moved on to another job. Nearby the university where I designed superchargers and positive displacement blowers. You CFD on that and then my third job I started at GE as a thermal engineer. I stayed it geez thermal engineering group for 3 1/2 years and then I moved to the. Inlets and exhausts of the military group, which I really enjoy. It's my true passion, so. When I started this, I would like to. Keep this career for a long time and it's the love of aircraft and work to get my passion.",5.0
"Hello I would like to teach you how to make fudge. Fudge is one of my families favorite little desserts. The recipe. Is right here. So basically the ingredients sugar, milk, butter and salt as well as marshmallows, chocolate and vanilla extract can be combined to make one of the tastiest treats. First you combine the sugar, milk, butter and salt. And mix them up in a medium sauce pan on the stove. Bring this up to a rolling boil and you have to thoroughly mix it so that every all the ingredients are homogeneous. Once these are mixed in you have to let it come to a rolling boil for 5 minutes. Once this is up to temperature you pull it off of the heat and add. The marshmallows, vanilla and chocolate chips. He makes these up and they will melt and as their melting you. You can see how the mixture will vary from looking like chocolate marshmallow. You just keep mixing until you get a nice chocolate. Consistency. Once this is done, you pour it into a. Container typically an 8 by 8 inch glass tray that has parchment paper in it and as you pour it in you'll see that it fills out the corners. And once this is done you take it and put it in the fridge for two hours, which is artist time to wait for your tasty dessert. After two hours, slice into pieces and enjoy.

"OK, so I was going to present on how I ended up in my current role. Um, so it's actually kind of by chance. Um, I actually went to school for human resources. And from there I graduated and I got a job and an aerospace company in Los Angeles during human resources. Only to find out that it wasn't really a great fit for me. Um, so from there I actually started looking around. It was a rocket manufacturing company, very exciting stuff, you know, lots of lots of passion around the job. So I started looking for groups there that I felt like I was really going to get the best experience out and really learn something and being, you know, being the fast-paced environment and being able to move and groove with everybody. And I actually ended up I interviewed for a team that did quality assurance. Um, so they're essentially the last line of defense for these rocket parts, and they're saying, hey, like, this is the last step. We have to make sure they're absolutely perfect before we put him on a rockets rocket science, right? Um, so I worked for that group, kind of building them up, and from there I I fell in love with manufacturing. Um, I loved seeing the parts physically being able to work with the parts. And so from there, I kind of stayed in the manufacturing area since then. So loved, loved the job, didn't love LA. So we ended up, um. I interviewed with GE Aviation and came over to even Dale and now I just wanted to see the rest of supply chain there, rest of sourcing. So I have been a buyer with GE for about three years now, one in the. Machining side and then recently I've joined the structural castings team and so far I love it, love seeing the parts, love working with customers, both internal, external and so I kind of fell into it by chance, but wouldn't change it for the world that's really not.",2.0
"So I'm going to do how to make ur favorite food. It's probably not everybody's favorite, but I am from the South, so it is absolutely my favorite food in the world. My favorite food is crawfish. So you have to ship them directly from Louisiana. Um, that's the best way to do it. I have to be alive also. So you ship um directly from Louisiana and they overnight EMM directly to your house. Um, once they're there, you know, if you don't need emm, if you're not cooking him right away, you should put him somewhere they can. Around, get some water, stretch out, you know, make sure there's still feeling OK. Um, you prep by you start boiling. Um, these big pots of water with propane, typically you would do it outside. You're not cooking this in your kitchen. Um, so usually. Ah, summertime food. So you start boiling some water, you add the seasoning, which is the most important pieces to have as much seasoning in there as you can. Um, if you want it to be just a little bit too spicy and it'll typically flavor it really well, you're going to add some corn. Corn cobs, cut in half. Potatoes, mushrooms, onions, anything that you really would want to have is like a side piece. In case people don't like crawfish or just as like a filler, um, and then once the water is boiling and then the side pieces are prepped and ready to go and they're nice and soft, that's when Mr adding the crawfish, you'll do little batches at a time. I would say maybe £2.00 at a time. You're going to have me in their their big pots. So you're cooking about £2.00 at a time. You throw him in there and wait about 8-8 to 10 minutes and then you take him straight out of there, straight him out of the water and then. Hopefully, if you're doing it the authentic way, you have a piece of paper on the table and you kind of dumping it on the table and you're eating it from there, and then you just kind of repeat that process.

It's easy to walk anywhere you want to go, and there's always tons to see. There's always food, there's always music. It's. Very lively. Everywhere you go you have to visit, you know, different areas as well. So starting in like Barcelona, you gotta do like a big city, see the people get a bit of the culture and things like that. And then from there you have to go down to the smaller towns. And that's where the people are really going to treat you like family. So they're going to show you the best food places, the best places to stay, the best places Wilson music. And you are never going to want to leave. So at least go for two weeks and not give you plenty of time to experience all the different kinds of towns.",

So one great thing is that exactly I get to stay home and kind of you know anything I need to deal with the perf for being able to stay at home. Um, and then one negative thing is I definitely miss all of my coworkers. I think being able to collaborate with people is great when you're on site and then so vice versa. 1 great thing about going in is, I think, you know, it's it's a great opportunity to see people bounce ideas off each other and really talk through problems and learning understand better. One thing that could absolutely be approved is how loud it is.

"Hello all. My name is Mark Bailey and I'm going to talk to you a little bit about how I ended up at work day. Really, it's quite a fun story. My wife and I were going to college at Utah State University. I had graduated a year before her in finance and I was kind of stuck in a dead end job. I was stuck at as a billing manager, not doing much with with my life. I wasn't making a lot of money, I wasn't happy with what I was doing. And as a new college graduate, I didn't really know where to go. Um, at that point, I'd heard of work day, but it wasn't even on my radar. I didn't know that they had anything that I could do with finance. Uhhh. I had interviewed for quite a few few banks and accounting firms around in the area and. After a while, I would even say or claim that it was divine intervention because none of my interviews were going well. I had a third party recruiter reach out to me and. They asked me if if I'd be interested in interviewing for work day. My interview went phenomenally well. Way better than any interview had ever done for any other company, and I just knew I was going to get the job. And I did. Now work. They hired me to come on in and be in the accountant for professional services accounting when we rolled out that that portion of our software clear back in 2016 and. I wasn't accounting for work day for three years and I loved it, loved every moment of it. But I started getting bored. I had very technical drive.

"Hello there. I'm going to be teaching a little bit about. Freeze dryers. You've ever heard of a freeze dryer before? Uhhh, Freeze Dryer is a device that helps you preserve food. My wife and I bought a freeze dryer earlier this year because we have a lot of fruit trees and we also hunt and we wanted a way to preserve our food for many years down the road. What you do with the freeze dryer is you prepare food weather in a raw or cooked state and you put it on sheets, kind of like cookie sheets. And put it into the freeze dryer. What happens at that point is really quite interesting. The freeze dryer will freeze the food at A at A at a degree much below 0, sometimes getting down to 150 degrees below 0 and what it does at that point is it. Puts a vacuum into the Chamber that all of your food is. Food is in and it starts to warm the chamber backup. Typically when you warm ice or frozen products in a normal environment, you're going to those products are going to melt, your going to get ice, or you're going to your fruits going to get mushy or different things like that, the things that you had previously frozen. In this environment where the frozen foods are in a vacuum chamber, there is a process called sublimation that occurs and the water actually goes from an ice state. Directly to a gas staton condensates on the outside of the freeze dryer, and after that's occurred for one to two days, you end up with products such as E speeches right here. Or these pairs that are ready to be put into backs and preserved for many years to come.",5.0

The work from home and flexible workstyle. Format. I can go into the office when I want to. I can work from home when it's convenient. COVID forced us into that.

"Hi, my name is Jesse Walters and I am here to tell you a little bit about my career path and how he ended up in the career and the role that I'm in. When I was fresh out of grad school I was in Nashville, TN and honestly I wanted to work in the music industry and unfortunately it was right. After the Great Recession. Not many options but a tech company was hiring in their HR technology team. I was really attracted by the fact they had benefits and a salary, so I took this job thinking this would be. A6 month stint in Tech, and instead I learned that I really enjoyed the process of eliciting requirements and working with developers and learning about all of the machinery behind the scenes of how HR and payroll works. So I ended up taking my next job at Utah Austin, where I was on a team that leverage some of those skills I have learned previously. And I was helping with a work day implementation. I was doing HM Business analysis, helping with unit testing and. Giving the requirements to our work day consultants. Eventually my husband took a job in California which meant we had to use. We had to leave Texas and we ended up in San Francisco. I applied to work day to. Continue building some of those skills, building consulting skills and always my North Star was to end up in management and leadership at work day.

"Teach some. OK, I promise I didn't hit the GO button yet. OK, hi, I'm Jesse Walters. I'm a consulting manager and I am here to give you some tips on how to run effective meetings. I wanted to give some of these tips today because working at work day, we've all seen that there are many common problems with meetings. As one example, people often come late to the meeting. People often leave early. Some people attend the meeting but don't contribute. The flip side of that problem is some people attend the meeting but get on a soapbox and derail the meeting. So. Today hope some of these tips will help keep your meetings on track. First of all, it starts with your calendar invite. Make sure your calendar invite has a really clear description and purpose and it states what the desired outcome of the meeting is. That way you know at the end of it whether you achieve the objective that you wanted from having that meeting. Also, highly recommend publishing a very detailed agenda and sending it to the participants. Well in advance. That way they can prepare appropriately and every now and then you'll get lucky and one of the participants will actually say, hey, I can actually answer these questions over e-mail and we can cancel the meeting. Make sure you were starting and ending on time. Make sure when you capture your action items during the meeting you're being really clear about who needs to do what by when. Publish your meetings afterwards that it's very clear what happened during the meeting and anyone who missed the meeting can review them and of course, continuously improve. Nobody is perfect at running the perfect, perfectly efficient meeting, so keep looking for ways you can improve.",6.0

"Hi, my name is Jesse Walters. I'm a consulting manager here at work day and today I'm going to talk a little bit about what is going well in the workplace and what could be improved a little bit. What's going well right now is that our consultants are so incredibly dedicated to our clients. They put in the work at night on weekends to really push our clients through a successful go live and we are so appreciative of all of their hard work. However, the thing that we could improve here is our consultants doing a little bit better for a job around setting boundaries. Sometimes they don't necessarily need to work that night or that weekend. They might be able to delegate a task to someone else who would appreciate the experience and has more bandwidth, for example. So I would encourage our consultants to work on that area.",5.0

"Good afternoon, my name is Michael Biagini and I am sharing with you this afternoon. How I came to the career that I'm in. It's probably a pretty similar story as many folks who will be doing the same exercise, but to begin with, they started in a small town in Hudson, NH. Used to be 45 minutes away from Boston, but with all the traffic and everything, it's now probably 90 minutes. I graduated from the University of New Hampshire and then took a trip down to. The University of Delaware, where I earned a Masters degree and started working in the state Budget Office. While there, I had a chance to meet then Senator Biden at an inauguration for the first female Governor of Delaware, Ruth Ann Minner. And spent about 10 years in various capacities always around technology and involved with technology, including a major assessment of the state's IT infrastructure and. How it handled technology as a statewide entity. It resulted in a massive restructuring of the organization and was the first one of the first CIOs to be created in the state. I left there in 2006 and moved to the University of North Florida. Where did anybody go? Completely sideways and it was just, ah, I began. The States the university first financial Systems department and then ultimately the 1st. PMO department. I left the university after 10 years, joining work day as a senior engagement manager, where I have been for the past almost exactly 7 years.",3.0
"Good afternoon, my name is Michael Biagini and today I will be sharing with you how to run the Boston Marathon successfully and lived to tell about it every year. On the third Monday in April, an estimated 35,000 runners assembling Hopkinton, MA. There, they begin in waves at 10:00 AM and will begin the 26.2 mile trip to Boylston Street in downtown Boston. In the next one minute and 30 seconds, I'm going to share with you how to be successful in that journey. 1st. And for most runners should not run too fast. In fact, they should intentionally slow down. I'm sure you're saying to yourself, wait, what? Slow down? What do you mean? Well, most runners in particular first time runners, run the course too fast. The course itself overall is a net decline course and that means that you end up at a lower point from where you begin. And specifically the 1st 6K is actually a significant decline and as runners go out too fast, they tax. Their quadriceps and their legs so much that when they get to the later stage of the race it makes those hills and that part of the course very difficult. Second, use the Wellesley scream tear advantage since 1911, the Wellesley College. Students have been gathering along the racecourse at Mile 13.1 and cheering for the runners as they go by. This screen can be heard about half a mile away from where it actually is, and it only grows louder as you get closer. Enjoy the moment as you go through the Scream tunnel. Finally, look at the Citgo sign once. If you continue to look at it once you start to enter Boston, I promise you it will be the longest 2 miles of your life. Head down Hereford. Left on Boylston. And raise your hands and celebrate your success as you pass the finish line.",6.0

"If you have a chance to go, I highly recommend making it to Steamboat Springs, Co in the winter for some skiing. Why? Well, first, there's nothing like being in Colorado in the winter snow skiing and being able to be outside in an area that has some 360 days of Sun every year. Second, there are always great bands playing on the outside patios so when you're wrapped up for the day it's easy to head over and listen to the outdoor bands while grabbing something from a pre ski beer, drink a little bit of food and spending some time with your family. The other reason that it's a great vacation spot is it's very family oriented, so there are a lot of things to do with kids and without the kids.",

One area that I think we could use some improvement on is just better ways for reference ability related to all of the assets that we have at our disposal.

That's about 5 miles in most estimates, which is far below the average distance most people used to commute to and from work. However, if you travel 5 miles. By walking statistics suggests that it would take you about. 50 minutes. And if you. Start your day out just thinking about that. You are more likely to be interested in continuing to maybe walk further. The second statistics I have is to share with you. Is that each person? Generates about four pounds of garbage per day, which is the equivalent of a brick. It may not seem like a lot, but each and every day over a year it sure adds up.",6.0

"Hi, I'm going to be using this time to teach you how to play. One of my favorite games, bocchi. Bocchi is a game that I've been playing for maybe 2530 years now. I've been playing since I was a child and I grew up in an Italian immigrant community here in Rhode Island. And my wife, actually her family, runs one of the baci clubs in town. There's a few. So I got involved playing in the league and the tournaments and actually have a game later on this evening. So the concept of Bochy is that there are two teams and the teams are in groups of four. So some teams have five or six players, but only four can play outta giving at a given time and each player is given a ball. So it's four on four. And we flip a coin to decide who gets to throw a little tiny ball called the Pauline, and that is to target ball. So whoever wins the coin toss gets to choose, just like in football with the coin toss, whether you want the ball or you can pick a color of the ball that you want to throw. And so usually. The team wins the coin toss, chooses that they want to throw the Pauline first. They throw the Pauline down the court and the court is generally about 60 feet. Some courts are 90 varying widths and they're made of different materials. The court that we have here locally that I play at is made out of silt more or less. So we have a lot of granite quarries that are in the region and we get a lot of granite dust and silt from those rocks and we use that on our courts and harden it and roll it. Other courts use hard true, which is the green tennis clay that you often see. And that that works just as well. In the concept that the game is to play to the 12 and it is about getting the once you throw the little ball. Teams that are going going, um, order more or less where you're throwing your ball as close as you can to the Pauline. And if you throw, for example, the first ball, the Red team throws the ball and its closest to the Pauline, then the green green team gets to go next in vice versa. So that's the concept of the game. Hope you enjoyed.",5.0

And what it is is basically if you know if you've been to Chipotle's I could Chipotle born, but it's customized for what you like. And what I do for my recipe it is to basically have animals vegan. So I go with vegan meat, simmer the vegan meat with a bit of water. And spices are typically used to tackle spice because it has a good flavor, but you can use anything that you'd like. And I basically also do rice, corn, black beans and guacamole. Ah, do Montgomery with perfect fresh avocado utilized. Emm, you crushed them however you like. You add pepper to it, paprika, all kinds of spices that you you like, but I use paprika and you just. Crash it, smash it, and make sure that it is. It is perfectly smooth. You cook the rice. I typically use truffle oil with the rise to give it an extra flavor and that that is really, really good. Like that you can have a corn either fresh or frozen and you just add it to the dish as well. And then, uh, black beans that are also having a can typically, but you can do them fresh as well if you have the time and. Basically cooked the meat, cook the rice, cook the corn and black beans and make my own guacamole. I have a vegan sound cream that I love to use as well and add it all together and with a great fresh drink and that's a perfect meal for the day. So thank you.",4.0

There are so many things to see, so many monuments, so many museums, so many restaurants to go to, so many different things to see constantly. The city constantly moves, so you have a lot of visuals, things that you can see, but also beautiful restaurants with amazing food that tastes from all over the world, all over the country of France.

"What I love about the workplace and working at Work day is really the flexibility of everything that I do on a daily basis. My job is very flexible, there's a great work life balance, so that's very definitely a positive. This is a wonderful opportunity for anybody that wants to be able to take care of your family and, um, have a balanced life with exercising and everything that you want to do as far as hobbies and everything. On the flip side, working from home. The workplace here could be a little bit lonely sometimes. You don't have people in the office that you can talk to, share ideas with, go to a conference room and have a meeting. You know, things like that in the phase two phase, also with a client, with COVID has been difficult. So working from home, not being able to see clients, not be able to see workmates and spend time with them has been very difficult. And that's the challenging part of the job.

"7500 steps, that's a huge number. That's the equivalent of about four to five miles and walking from average people. Can you believe that? That'll help her big number. So to put in perspective, that's probably, if you're familiar with New York, going across the Brooklyn Bridge probably twice, you know, going from Brooklyn to New York back to Brooklyn or vice versa, or staying on a New York side, going back on the New York side. So you know that Bush about 2 1/2 miles along, I believe. So that's about how it is. Or if you, again, familiar with New York City, going from Times Square down to the World Trade Center, that's probably a good idea of what it looks like. Otherwise, if you're going to the Las Vegas Strip, that's probably the length of basically where the Luxor is to the stratosphere, maybe a little bit less, but that's about the distance that it takes for 7500 steps.",5.0
"My career path was a bit unconventional. This is my first job, so. It's really more of the story behind how I got to this drop and how I. Pursued a career in this tech industry. Um. So when I first went to college, I started as a biology major. I wanted to pursue a medical career, in particular to be a physician's assistant. I quickly realized that I did not like labs. I I liked science, but the lab portion of. All these classes was just taking up too much time and wasn't giving me a lot of hours. So then I thought, OK, I'll switch to a business major. I took accounting. Hated that. So. I thought, OK, what is the common denominator between these two different majors that. I can find common ground with um. And so I decided to become a math major. That led me to pursuing more computer science classes and eventually working in. App development over a summer between my junior and senior year of college and. I went to one of my career counselors and basically asked her with my resume, what do you see? Mi fit into what kind of industry? And she she looked at me and was like, you know I I heard there's a company called work day that's coming and I stumbled across the info session and. Here we are. Yeah, I like that.

"My favorite work day product by far is. Really not even a work day product. It is more of a framework to. Start. Integration builds from and we're trying to bake it into actually work days product. However it's right now. Just being work done internally by consultants. So what it does is provide a framework it. Has different components to it that our parameter izabelle. So what you can do is for different processes. That need. To be coated in your integration, you can specify. Different values to be used. So for example, if you have to make a soap call and grab data from work day, um, you know we have a whole directory of web services that you can use, but each of those would be configurable in our product, which is called SSC. And so that's something that, you know, I really like to use. It's really helpful. Um. How to parameterise it does require studio experience but. It's basically populating certain fields with certain values depending on your requirements. So in order to successfully implement an integration with work day, you will be required to use this product. However, it hasn't been fully baked into work days product.",4.0

However, there are opportunities on other projects where I wouldn't be the lead.

My favorite vacation is in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Why do I say that? It is remote, but it allows you to disconnect and really. Feel like you are? Alone and with nature and. I guess the best part of that vacation was realizing the beauty of our country and. How vast the mountains are, and there's just so much to do. There are two national parks in Wyoming. Um, there's Yellowstone and. Have. You get the grand Tetons. The wildlife there is amazing. You are bound to see a moose, elk, all sorts of different animals.",
"In terms of talking about the Atlanta Office physical workplace, there are a couple of things I could pick that are going well. I, um, if I had to stick to one, I would say. Teams are doing a good job of coming into the office and actually taking advantage of moments that matter. We our culture is great year, we have happy hours, we have team events, we have a land office events just coming back together from COVID and really diving into the work day culture that we know and love so much. That's been going really well. The only thing is we do have. Constraints on the number of deaths that we have. So that's been causing some friction just between.

You know, picked up my phone, went to give her the, went to find her number and it wasn't even there. And I just I thought, that's really odd. I've worked with work day for five years and and suddenly my managers number is not in my phone. So a couple days later something very similar happened with somebody else from work day when I was talking to them on the phone. And I I finally went wait, something's wrong. I started Googling. You know, did I upgrade my phone to iOS? What happened? And I saw some issues. But then it hit me that I had upgraded my e-mail or changed my e-mail out and that something could have happened there. So I spent two hours that evening doing research and going through and finding every single step that had to be done to actually be able to find my contacts again. Because none of my contacts for five years were there, which was insane. So I found out there were multiple steps I had to go through to redo some settings on my phone. I was actually able to get my phone back or my all my contacts back, not my phone. And discovered also that I had been saving all my contacts on my work day e-mail for five years and I had to move them all over so that, you know which should should I ever win the lottery and. And leave work day or retire that I would actually have my contacts. So I it will take a while to actually move those over and it's kind of a pain, but I was really, really pleased that I had not lost all my contacts. Thank goodness.",2.0
"Hey, good afternoon, everybody. I want to teach you today to how to make a Berry Mojito. This is one of my favorite drinks, and it's one of my favorite drinks next to the pool. So I'm, I'll guarantee you, if you like sweet drinks, you're gonna like this one. I'm going to go through the ingredients, I'm gonna talk to you about the tools, and then I'll give you the process to make it. And then hopefully I don't have to tell you how to enjoy it. But so the ingredients are raspberries. 1 lime cut into Aiden eh sorry. Eights segments um, ice cubes. Sugar in the raw. And club soda. Lots of fresh mint and ice. Um, the tools that you're going to need is Tara tall glass, along bartending spoon and a muddler. So the first thing that you're going to do is Model 1 wedge of lime with about, I would say 1520 um mint leaves in a glass. Muddle that. Then put 2 tablespoons of sugar in the raw. In sugar in the raw is. Awesome for this, because it actually breaks up. The mint leaves a little bit better and also crushes the lime better. Um, so throw the two tablespoons of sugar in mud a little bit more than throw two more wedges of lime and muddle that more. Then you can pour in about 1 1/2 ounces. Oh, sorry. Then fill the glass with ice. Sorry. Let me go back and fill the glass with ice, then pour in 1/2 ounces. Of white rum. I use Bacardi white rum. If you happen to have a child that's drinking this or someone who can't have alcohol, then go ahead and um, uh, go ahead and. Sorry.

I would say the best thing about working uhhh remotely and we're working from home is the fact that you can get a few things done during the day. You know you can throw that load of laundry and you can let that person in the drawer that's going to do repair, etc. So that's actually very, very nice. Just say the bad things sometimes is when something goes wrong, you know, technically or something, it might take a little bit more to get it, um, get it fixed or diagnos it just because you're doing some of it on your own.

"My name is Sidney Jones and I'm a senior consultant with work day. And today I'm going to talk to you about how I got into this role. So when I think about what led me to work day, it was really my love of two things, education and technology. And then the third thing that landed me here was actually a conversation at a bar. So I'll start with education. I have worked in the field of education for close to 20 years now. I started out as a teacher. Both at the 1st grade level and then I later taught at a university and following that I found myself taking on a number of different program administration roles now. The one thing that always stuck with me and the one thing that I always gravitated towards where the sticky projects that no one really wanted to touch. And that kind of led me to my second passion that led me to work day, which is my love of technology, so when the lot of these projects that I was on. I was managing large datasets and trying to pull things together from a lot of different systems and because we never had one system that really worked well, we spend a lot of time in Excel and. There were a lot of issues with that, right. Documents went safe, right. They would crash. We were concerned about data security and that really led me to thinking about how I could sort of leverage technology in the field of education to make things better for, you know, both administrators and students. And from there I started talking to people and was led by network know that I was open to some new opportunities which. I talked to people for awhile and it didn't really feel like it was going anywhere. But flash forward to the fall of 2019 and I ran into an acquaintance at a bar who was working for work day and he said to me, look, you know, their work, they had this new education product and I think you'd be really good at it. So I sent in my resume, he sent it to a recruiter and from there the rest is history, had really great conversation, and decided to. Join work day? No. I told people the bar part because it's catchy. But I think the truth is I did a lot of networking to kind of get there. So yeah, there are a lot of great conversations that happened before that.",4.0
"Hi there, welcome to cooking in the world's least sanitary kitchen. Today I am going to breakdown how to cook one of my favorite foods, a grilled cheese, in three steps. So step one is you need to collect your ingredients and relevant cooking items. And there are six items I'm going to talk about today. The first is handy flipper to flip your grilled cheese. The second is the hand that you want to cook it in. The third is a piece of bread, the 4th. Item that you need is one of the most important ones and my husband says always double up on this one. It's the cheese and the 6th item which I was not allowed to bring into my fake kitchen slash office today for safety purposes is a flame. So you'll want a stove or something to make the grilled cheese hot and multi Step 2. Then I always encourage people to think about when they are making a grilled cheese is the enjoyment of the items that you are the ingredients that you were using when you cook. Ah, geez. So I have this home in focaccia here. It's a pretty great bread, but if you like the classic grilled cheese of childhood, go for the wonder bread. Today I'm rolling into the American cheese, but I also have a collection of Nancy cheeses that I spent way too much money on when I was in Vermont a couple weeks ago. So if you want fancy cheeses, I highly recommend that as well. Oh, and another ingredient that I forgot to mention before is butter. You're going to want that to make sure that you had a nice. Crispy sear on your bread. So once you kind of thought those sinks through, the last step is to cut the grilled cheese and knew that you were going to put your pot on the blame. I usually use a medium heat, but it will depend on the type of flame that you were using. Then you do bread, cheese, bread. Put it together. Um, melt your butter. Once the butter is melted, you're going to put the sandwich in the pan. Wait until it's nice and crispy on the bottom. Flip it over. Cut into diagonals to remind yourself of childhood and enjoy.",4.0

So it's a lot of taking those different pieces and figuring out how we can arrange them. And then the second piece along with that is I talk about their processes and what can we can do to make them smoother.

"My favorite game currently is pickleball. It is currently the fastest growing sport in America. It's gained a lot of popularity over the last few years and during the pandemic. Um, really easy way to think of pickleball is a hybrid between tennis and. Ping pong. So it is played on what you can think of as a small tennis court. It is separated by. Four different sections of the court, like a tennis court, and it also has an area. Near the net, called the kitchen. So the way the game starts is by one team serving underhand serve to the other team and hitting it diagonally across the court to the player on the opposite side. Once the ball is served, it needs to bounce once on each side, so the server hits it over, it bounces on the opposite side, the opposite side hits it back, and it needs to balance. After it has bounced twice, the ball can be hit in the air whenever you'd like. One thing to know is that you cannot go in an area called the kitchen or the the non volley zone and hit the ball out of the air unless it has bounced. It is single point scoring, so if the other team faults, that means you have a point for your team. And typically the game is played to 11 and you need to win by two. And you can play the game in up two games of three. So best of three series or best of five series is what is typically done. And that is how you play pickleball.",4.0

"I want to explain to everybody how to make my favorite food sushi. Sushi is an amazing meal. It's raw fish covered with rice and other items to make. Sushi is not always the easiest. You have to make sure that you have shichimi fish, meaning fish that can be eaten raw. Getting that, there are a number of Japanese grocery stores or there are still some specialty grocery stores that do sell it. When you get the fish, you also want to make sure that you have a. Very sharp knife. You need to make sure you make exact cuts to cut your fish so you can put it inside your rolls or on top of the rice. Um, Coco makes mazing knives for sushi. Little advertisement there. So what we do is you would lay out your filets of fish. You would cut them into strips. You also then would make sushi rice. Best way to make it inside a rice cooker. When you get the rice you would then take it. You would take, eh actually take a rolling pad which is made from bamboo. You would put some plant, some Saran wrap. You would take the rice and make it completely flat. You would cut your rice, you cut your fish in sections, put it inside your rice and then actually roll it. Sushi is best. Eat. And if you take that role and you try to cut it into six or eight even pieces, making sure they're not too big to eat. Other compliments to sushi would be wasabi, which is actually a spicy horseradish and ginger, which helps take care of that bite. Sushi is an amazing meal, and I hope you enjoy it.",6.0

So what I did is I was an accountant for 10 years. During that. I chose to go get my masters. Degree. When I got my masters degree, I I did it with a number of folks who worked at a company called Hewitt Associates. So when he would associate is a benefit, it was a benefit consulting firm. Within that I was able to expand into HCM. What I do at work day is I'm an engagement manager, which I get to use both sides of my experience. For 10 years I worked in accounting and for another 10 years I worked in technology benefit consulting at Work day as an engagement manager. I lead our work day engagements, which are implementations of HCM and financial deployment. I'm able to use my background as an accountant when I was first out of school, as well as my years in independent consulting as well as benefit consulting. And with that I'm able to do my job as a principal engagement manager at work day.",5.0
"Hi, I'm Mark Stevens and I just want to talk a bit about how he ended up in my current role. It really stems from when I was at university and I was taking a sandwich course, so I needed a sponsor, industrial sponsor to go along with that where I could get the. Experience the training um outside of college and I was hoping to go into the telecommunications sector with cable and wireless but didn't make it through the selection process. Was looking around for another sponsor and I landed up with British Aerospace. Stayed with them through through college and a good few years beyond gaining experience in systems engineering and really enjoyed it and found that my passion really was in in aviation. So it's really been at the career that I've I've stayed in throughout working for at the Mo D and now with the GE Aerospace. I've stayed with the systems engineering in my career and my electronics background from university is also played its part. But I've I've really sort of majored in in systems and software engineering. In a number of roles with G and. Gradually moved into project management. It was something that I did a little bit with the Modi had some project management experience there, but found that's really my passion and. What I love to do so. I've. Had a number of roles in that area and and of gradual increasing responsibility and today I'm the engineering project manager in charge over the electrical load monitoring system for, UM, the Boeing Triple 7X aircraft. So I look after all aspects of the program, budget and schedule, etc. Across all of the functions, including mechanical, electrical and so on. So there we are. That's how I ended up in the role I have now.",4.0
"I'm just going to talk about my favorite product, which is a pocket hole jig. This is a. Metal device that you use when you want to join two pieces of wood at right angles. Something you might do with their traditional joint, um, taking a lot of time to put together. This allows you to do it quickly and securely with screws. Um, it's a metal device which has a slider on it that you set according to the thickness of your material using a gauge on the side. And it has two holes in the top through which you can drill into the wood at an angle. You mount your piece of wood vertically in and then you clamp it up tight with the clamp on the device so it's held securely and then you use. One of the drills um drill bits that come with the kit to make those holes. There's a color on the drill bit that you set so that it stops just short of the bottom so you don't drill into the the jig itself, but. You make those holes using the special bit and then remove the piece of wood from the clamp. You then use another clamp to clamp it to the piece of material that you're joining it too, so they're perfectly aligned. You don't want to move as you then driving in the screws, which is what you do next. So. Like the screws in, remove the clamp and then you should have a joint of two pieces of wood which is secure but quick to do and um. After that, you can tidy up. You can get special plugs that go into these holes that you've made, which are oblong. Slide those in, glue them in, and it allows you to have a real clean finish so you don't see the fact that it's held together with screws at all. So there you go. That's my favorite product at the moment.",4.0

"My favorite vacation destination would have to be Cornwall. It's in the southwest of the UK and it's the place I grew up, but we often go back there for family holidays now. The reason is so great is because of the mix of the terrain. There you've got the see with the rocky cliffs which on a. Lovely sunny day. Uh, there's nowhere else better to be and the beaches are generally beautiful. Sand. Um, so no better place to be. On the other hand, you've got the the Moreland, so that's very rugged and scenic and, um, very beautiful.

But it's a fairly standard office environment. Um, fairly open layout. Um, one thing that's going well. I think the way that people are starting to come back into the office after COVID is working very well.

"Good afternoon, class. I'd like to share with you all my journey into the aviation field. It started in 2006 when it came time to graduate high school. I honestly knew nothing about the aviation world at that point in time. However, I always had a solid mechanical aptitude and found much enjoyment from fixing things and going fast. That's why I decided to enlist in the United States Air Force as an aircraft engine mechanic. Once I returned from training, I began to work on the EH10 aircraft, which by the way has GE engines on it. A few years after that, our base transition to the F15 aircraft, which I am still working on today, 16 1/2 years later. In parallel with my National Guard duties, I got a degree and started working on civilian aircraft at a local airport. I was working towards receiving my FAA airframe and powerplant certificate. However I ended up taking a different path and I left the area and applied to several companies in the in the Boston location. One of which was GE Aviation in length. Now, Needless to say, I got that job, or else I wouldn't be here talking to you today and taking this training. I've been with G for 10 years. I started as a test process engineer on military and commercial engine programs. I then took a role in quality as the quality leader on T700 engine assembly. I did that for about two years and ended up moving back to test, which is where I'm at now, and I'm the power plant engineer 47167 engines. Mainly working on root Cause analysis, first time yield and lead time improvements. Thank you. Have a good day.",6.0
"Good morning, class. Several weeks ago I went fishing with a few friends off the coast of New Hampshire. Now when I say off the coast, we actually went 35 miles out. We were targeting mostly bottom fish such as cod, Pollock and cusk. Well, we weren't targeting were sharks, which we caught many of and just toss them back in the water. Once we got back to the shore, we divided up the catches and I went home to cook the fresh Pollock. I decided to try something new and fry these fish, which I'm going to outline now how I cooked it. The first step is to fill a large sized cast iron pan with canola oil. I filled it until it was about 2 inches deep. I placed the pan on the grill and heated it up until it was 350 degrees and this will take about 30 minutes to do. Next, we prepared the fish while we wait for the oil to heat up. Take the fillets, cut them up into single portion sizes around 6 inches long. Then mix 1 cup of flour, a teaspoon of salt, pepper, and some Cajun spice for some heat if you like the heat, which I do. Make sure the fish is completely drive. Placed it in the flower bowl and coat all sides of the fish. Now begin. Placing the fish into the hot oil, do at one at a time to keep the splashing down. Fry the fish for about 5 minutes on each side or until golden Brown. When the fish are done, place them on a drying rack for about 5 minutes to allow the excess oil to drip off and the fish to cool down. At this point, you could either make tartar sauce or cut up some lemons if you wanted. I went with just the lemons for taste. Now you're ready to enjoy the freshly cooked fish.",5.0

"Hi, my name is Kelly Long and I'm going to talk to you about how I got into my career. Out of university, I joined GE Aviation in a rotational program in their government contracts group. I knew nothing about contracts coming into the role, but I was attracted to the business and wanted to be a part of the industry. So my first year on the program, I spend in Cincinnati doing rotations in sourcing compliance. And government contracts. And then after a year I moved to Lynn, MA outside of Boston and supported the international contracts team as well as the government contracts team at that facility for a year. From there. I then moved to Grand Rapids, MI where I've been for the past seven years supporting the systems business, specifically avionics. I primarily in my my first couple years in there in the role I primarily supported military programs with Boeing defense. Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman. Over the past couple years, I've transitioned to more of the civil commercial space. I supported one of GE startup businesses, arrows, for a few years. And then over the past year and a half to two years, I've been supporting the Boeing Commercial Airplanes programs for avionics. So thank you. In my role I interface a lot with program managers. B.

"Today I'm going to teach you about my family's favorite dish, black pepper chicken stir fry. So first you're going to want to grab your chicken and dice it up into chunks, and then you're going to want to get your spices ready in. The spices include turmeric, black pepper, garlic powder, garlic, salt, and some regular salt. And we're going to put the chicken into a bowl, and then we're going to add our spices in and mix up the chicken around so you get all of this spices all over the chicken. And then we're going to transfer the chicken into a skillet, which we're going to put some oil in as well to soil up the pan and then put the chicken in there. So while the chicken is cooking, you're going to grab your broccoli and onion and you're going to chop those up pretty finely. Once the chicken is done cooking, you're going to transfer the broccoli and onion into that same pan with the chicken, and you're going to pour a little bit of soy sauce in there and add any of your leftover spices from the bowl from the chicken earlier into the pan. And you're going to let that cook for 10 to 15 minutes or so on low heat. So while that's cooking, you're going to want to boil a pot of water for our noodles. So once the once the pot is boiling, you pour your noodles in, get those cooking, then you're going to remove it from the heat and then pour the noodles back into the bowl without the water. And we're going to add coconut milk and butter, and we're going to just let the noodles soak in that broth. And then you're going to add in some hot Peppers, and you're pretty much done from there. So next is plating. So you're going to put the noodles into. Bowl and put the chicken and vegetables on top and there you go.",6.0

"Hey, I would like to mention about my favorite product which I've created here. It's called patent intelligence dashboard. So the name itself says its patent intelligence. So this dashboard consists of the patterns, metrics of the different companies on different technology areas. So let's say for example G aviation works on gas turbine engines and what would in the dashboard would be able to? Showcase the number of patterns or G has within the tub and technologies versus the competition and we can literally compare the quantitative data in terms of the number of patterns and shown across the different sub technology areas within the gas stove and engine so. Dad, what you can identify is where G is strong and where our competition is strong or where we both have kind of you know a very aggressive quantity in terms of patterns. So that would help us in developing the white spaces or maybe the weaknesses strengths and develop an IP strategy pattern strategy to kind of you know filed some more patterns where we lack some technology areas where the competition is working on and it also gives us a hint on. We're not friends and weaknesses and we can kind of be proactive, assertive and maybe we can try and target the competitors saying, hey, you know what, you're copying our patterns so and it might end up in a patent litigation suits and so on.

Earlier this year, just really started having some discussions with my boss, my family, about that need just to be a learner again. I think I had become just way too comfortable. I was no longer really being challenged. I wanted some opportunities to actually advance and learn some new things. And being in the EHS arena, um, it had gotten to a point where. I'm not gonna say I was an expert, but I wasn't really learning anymore, so I took that opportunity just to do a few get to knows. I reached out to a few peers and I looked at some different opportunities within GE Aviation. My background, I also have some, uh, I was a certified auditor course. I've worked with compliance, regulatory agencies, various inspections within the EHS World. So there was a lot of similarity with quality systems. Um, prior coworker, actually, he and I had a discussion and I interviewed maybe two days later, got a call that next day. So it actually went very fast. I will say that right now. I am excited.

"Hi. So it's fall. It's football season. Go Cowboys. So one of the things I just wanted to talk about is making some of my favorite football snacks. One of my specialties is my Buffalo chicken dip. I love things that are spicy. I love on football Sundays just to have something that's like fattening. And I'm not worried about any calories or carbs. So one of the things I do is I always go by, eh, shredded. Rotisserie chicken, typically from just one of the local grocery stores, bottle of Hidden Valley Ranch Franks hot sauce, a block of cream cheese, and tons of various shredded cheeses. I typically put all of that into a pot on the stove and get it nice and smooth. There's a lot of stirring. You don't want to overcook it or burn it or anything, so I stir that for a pretty long period of time. Just to get a very smooth consistency, I then take that pot and I pour it into a baking dish, cover it with tons of shredded cheeses and just as much cheese as you want. Um, turn it on 350 and I let that cook for typically 30 to 45 minutes or so. Um, once it's taken out, I always have to have something to salty. I can't do the veggie. So back to the not worrying about carbs and calories. Uh, typically will do some type of tortilla chips or Fritos or something with it, arrange it pretty nice, you know, for presentation. But it's always a hit. One of great things is, is that my husband and one of my sons, they hate anything spicy.

"Hi. Today I'd like to talk to you about what is uh. Audio mixer and how do you? Makes sense of what it is and how to operate it, and audio mixer is a device that accepts multiple mic input channels and helps you balance or change the volume of the various signal paths that's coming into the mixer. And. Send it out to the. People listening the audio in a very pleasant way, so the control that you have basically as the signal comes into the mixer is basically the gain, which is basically how sensitive the mic ought to be. And then you can also change some of the frequencies of the signal that's coming in, like a high frequency, meet frequency and low frequency. And after that you have a fader which basically helps the volume of these signal that goes into that Channel and what is being perceived as listening by the users. And finally you have a master fader, a master fader basically. Lifts the volume of the entire mix. So if you have five um Mike signals coming in, the master fader would actually lift the signal, or of course bring it down, depending on what you want of all the five together. So that's a quick. Uh, I'd say walkthrough on what an audio mixer is and how to operate one. I hope this has been helpful for folks who have not seen or understood what an audio mixer is. Thank you.",4.0

"Hi. I work in the NPR, the North Point facility here in Cincinnati. It's a fantastic location that's close to a lot of amenities you want. You know, you did a lot of restaurants nearby. The facility itself is a very secure facility. It has good office furniture, agronomic chairs and of course, you do need to have proper access. Because there is a security guard who make sure that you have access to the building. So All in all, it's a great facility.

My first interaction with Work day took place in 2014 when my previous company decided to implement a global HM system and Work Day was selected.

"Wall painting is one of my favorite hobbies that I like to do in my free time. Today I will provide you the steps needed to achieve a successful painting outcome. The first thing that you need to do in order to paint successfully is to plan what you're going to be painting and choose the colors that you want to paint. Once you choose the colors and make a decision on what colors is, what color is going on each wall, your next step is to pick the tools and materials required. Every project and every paint painting required requires specific tools such as paint paint roller, paint roller extension, pole drop cloth, paint brushes, paint tray, sandpaper, painters tape rags, and putty knife. Once you have all the tools ready, start by determining how much paint you want. You'll need the paint. The amount of paint required is based on the number of walls that you're going to paint and based on the number of rooms that you're going to paint. Your next step is to prep the walls and the room. This includes covering all furniture and covering all hardware that exists in the room in order to keep everything clean. Once you have all the furniture covered, your next step is to start by making sure that the walls are smooth so that you don't have overlapping gaps when painting. Your next step is to prep the paint. If you chose a color that's combination of different colors, make sure you mix the paint properly so that you achieve the color you want. Pick your painting techniques, whether that's starting with the. Feeling or starting with the walls. Once you have a decision made, start by painting the walls and then paint the ceiling and make sure that the paint is applied equally across all their own. By doing this you'll achieve the outcome required. Thank you.",5.0

"Hi, today I like to share my experience how to prepare your kids for the D1 college tennis players. First, we know this is not easy text. Your kids needs to have talents and they need to allow the spot. I'm in tennis. On the other side, probably most important is they need work very hard for a long time and uh, probably probably about 10 years. And for the parents that's not that's also not easy. Text they need to invest a lot of money, uh, probably about 20 K per year for 10 years. And also they need spend a lot of time to, you know, pick up your keys and drove them to the training, take them to the tournament, all those things. Two. Typically for the case we start to train them around 6 to 8 years old. For this stage the focus is really help them to. Would the correct fundamentals, how good habit know how to swing the ball, how to move your feet? So I think the most important part for this stage is find a good coach who focus on those fundamentals and around 9:00 to 11:00, I think your case can start to play some local tournament. The goal for this stage is. Have them. Know how to play a tennis under pressure, how to you know have a good game strategy, how to apply what we learn from your coach to the real game situation. And during this process they also will earn the point for UST point and also in improve their ranking. I think by the time of like 131415 that's the time you can check their ranking. I think if they are in the top 100 for their great. You will have good chance to be, uh, you know, D1 tennis player. So it's up to you and your kids make a decision as a set point whether you want to go forward or not. If you make the decision for the next stage is really focus on the tennis.

"Hello and welcome to my session on how to grow a stick. Now you might be wondering, how does one go about growing a stick? Well I'm here to help you understand this process. Now, first of all, you need to acquire a plant. This can be done through multiple ways. I suggest giving 1 gifted to you or purchasing 1 from your local nursery. What I don't recommend is trying to grow your own plant from seed 'cause. Otherwise you'll probably grow plant and not be very good at growing a stick and so once you've acquired said plant. The first step in growing a stick is to really fail at watering the plant, so that might mean overwatering. A plant that is based in the desert, underwater, in a plant that is in the tropics, or just being really inconsistent in that in your watering regimen. Now, once you become really inconsistent in your watering regimen, the next if I recommend is placing the plant in a room that gets practically 0 natural light. The furthest it can be from a window or from the outside, the better, and transforming your plant into a stick. I recommend a window that a room that might be a little drafty, perhaps that room. Is it fluctuates within heat, temperature, perhaps the moisture in the room also fluctuates. Um, but you really want to avoid any sort of natural sunlight, fresh air, or a stable environment for that plant. And what you'll find is overtime. With the inconsistency and watering, the general neglect and lack of care, you 2 can turn any plant into a stick. Thank you.",5.0

We all must remain on the latest and greatest version of software for CMMC compliance and it is time for me to show you how to do a software update on your iOS device. First of all, need to pick up your device and unlock it so that you can see your home screen and then we're going to find the settings icon. The settings icon is a great little icon that has gears and looks, kind of. It says settings underneath it, so you should be able to find it pretty easily. It should be sitting right there on your home screen. Go ahead and tap that for me and then once it opens, so you're going to hit general and then you're going to choose software update. It's going to automatically check the Apple servers for software updates and bring you with an option to install the latest version. So then you're going to hit the download and install. Version it. At this point it may ask you for your PIN code that you used to unlock your phone, so go ahead and type that in and then it's going to say update requested. If you are having problems with this, you must be connected to the Internet of course, so that's either on Wi-Fi or over 5G. And in order to successfully install the update, you also must have at least 50% battery or be plugged into your charger. Cord. So if you are seeing the update requested and or a little countdown that says that it may take 7 minutes to finish downloading or anything like that, then you're all set. So sit back and go get a cup of coffee and let your phone do the software update. The download portion is the easy part. It then will sit there at eh preparing stage for quite a few minutes while it finishes the update. Thank you.",5.0

"I started working as a materials application engineer for GE Aviation with a series of what I call happy accidents. When I graduated from college with my chemical engineering degree, I had no idea what industry I wanted to go into, so I did what any college student would do at the time and I took the first job I was offered. This had me contract ING with UTC Aerospace systems, and I realized I was sort of interested in the industry but didn't like the type of engineering I was doing. So I shifted over to work for Sikorsky helicopters for awhile in their materials and processing department. There I started learning a lot about metals and coatings and it really started getting me excited about the types of applications they had. Then one day, out of the blue, I got a call from a manager at GE Aviation that wanted to talk to me about a new posting they'd be putting out in the next couple months. To this day I don't know how they got my resume or my phone number, but I'm so happy that it worked out. They called me a few months later for an interview and the rest has been the best job of my career so far. Once I got into GE aviation, of course more chaos with pandemic. I ended up moving around 2-3 different teams in less than two years. During that time I got. Well-rounded education and all that GE Aviation does and ended up in the materials application engineer role where I've been for the last two years. If you told me when I was 16 that I'd be working with polymeric matrix composites. I would have thought. You know you are a crazy person from the future today. I couldn't imagine doing anything else.",5.0
"Today I'd like to talk about how to properly layer your skin. Care to create an effective routine to keep you looking young and fresh for as long as you can. The most important part of your skin care processes to have a very gentle cleanser that you can use with both the morning and evening. If you're washing your face in the evening, it's helpful to do a double cleanse to make sure you're getting rid of all of the dirt and oils that are on your skin and that it can breathe properly throughout the whole night. Following your cleanser, it's good to use a toner that you can gently apply with your fingertips. This can help even out your skin tone. It can help with any blemishes that you may have and just give you a general brighter future. Following your toner, a lot of people like to add serums into their routine, though it's not as necessary. Serums can be great for adding hydration to your face with a little vitamin C, or it can be great for cell regeneration. This means your skin can turn over faster, it can heal any blemishes quicker and you'll be looking good as new. Following your serums, you want to work your way from lightest to heaviest so that way it can absorb properly through your skin. And once all of that is done, you want to let it rest on your face for a minute or so just again to give it lots of time to absorb. Once that's done, you go ahead and apply a light moisturizer. You want this to be free from any oils or fragrances, so that way it doesn't irritate your face. And finally, if you're going out and about for the day, you always want to apply an SPF of at least 30 or 50. This will make sure you're not getting any sun damage and stay looking great for the rest of your days.",7.0

"My favorite vacation destination was Florence, Italy, and I recommend that anyone travels there if they get the opportunity to go out of the country. This was my favorite destination because it combines the best of food culture, locals, language, and you really just get a full package. When you're traveling through Florence, they have a lot of great art museums and historical sites that you can visit, but it's not completely overrun with tourists because it is a little bit of a smaller city. You get to experience the food, and it's not Americanized, based on a tourist culture again, it's a lot more. True to the Italian culture gives you a great opportunity to practice language with locals, and it's just a beautiful city to walk around and see all of the architecture.",
"I work as an engineer for the GE even Dale campus. There are things that I both love and dislike about working in this environment. One of my favorite things about working on the campuses how there is a variety of labs, shops and different groups working there and it's a great place to go explore. You get to see a lot about how the products are developed to how they're made and that's a very cool experience. The lawn team also does a great job of making the outdoor environment beautiful, especially in the winter times with lots of lights. One thing that they could do a little bit better is work on the labs and the office conditions. Every so often there is trash or debris that's not quite cleared away. That could make for a happier environment if it was taken care of.",7.0

"OK, hello everyone. So I would like to teach about sport called squash. Squash is a two person racquet sport and is placed. It is played in eh what it's called Squash Court. It is similar to a racquetball court which is surrounded by 4 is it goes on wall four sides and you hit the ball with the state tennis sized racket and it bounces off the front wall and then the opponent plays it. So you go back and forth and there's a point system which. Um. With declares the winner. There are several rules in squash, um, and you start off by a survey and the survey is is is done from one side of the court to the other side of the court and has to go. The server has to be above the center line that is on the front wall. The server throws the ball, he serves the ball, the receiver gets the ball and plays it towards the front wall again, and both players go back and forth, hitting the front wall and. The key is that the ball can only bounce on the ground once. If it bounces twice, then the hitter of the ball loses a point. So the objective is to keep the ball in play and make sure that the ball only bounces on the ground once. Um, the point system works by adding up the points, and whichever player gets to 11 points first wins. If two players have 10 points each and they have the same level of points, then then it's basically a deuce. So the one person has two big two points in a row to win to win the set, and it's a best of five match. So that's how squashes played.",4.0

"My name is Ahmed Adil. I'm a senior engagement manager in the West Work Day professional services team I have. Worked on many projects. I have collaborated with many people here and the one person I do want to mention is who going viral. He's a payroll consultant and I have recently worked with him on a difficult project where we troubleshooted customer problems we worked with with with their senior leadership. We identified issues, resolved problems and made sure that all the project deliverables were completed and now we are at a stage where we about to go live and about to run their very first payroll for them. In addition to that, I also want to mention two or other resources who have who have worked really hard on the project they. Also, again, work very closely with the customer and work across different teams and made sure that all the project deliverables were there when the other question I do want to answer is, um. It's just telling me about my. About myself, how I got to this position. I've been an engagement manager for about 10 years now, before work day, where I've been for five years before work day, I was one of the another company called Skill Soft. I was in skill soft for about three years and learn my project management skills there. And. Before skill soft I was at Italica Telecom Company where I learn about technology and how it operates and so on. I have a degree in computer engineering and.

"Favorite vacation spot. So I'd have to say one of my favorite ones was the island of Saint Lucia and stayed at an incredible inclusive resort. Food was amazing. It was, um, I believe was called a beaches. But, um, unbelievable food. So the you had the opportunity to go to different restaurants all the time. So there was the buffet of different restaurants. Beach was incredible. Fantastic Weather 2. There's also opportunity to go for hikes nearby to look at some abandoned ruins. Apparently the British had been there earlier and left binds and cannons and forth, so that was super interesting. And also you could go for various day excursion. So did uh, date excursion to another island, which was also amazing. Although if you're seasick, it was a speedboat and that wasn't so great and I'm up.",
"OK, so one thing for the work day workplace that is going really well I have to say, is the snacks. So fantastic snacks. Every time I go there's a lot of healthy options too, so you can have like fresh fruit, apples, blah, blah blah. But also in the process section, there's always healthy snacks there too. So protein bars, etc, which is really helpful actually if you're stuck between meetings and eat something really quickly. One thing that could be better at the Workplace Office is the actual connection. So there's been times where I've gone with my laptop and I'm getting ready to set up and trying to connect to the monitor and missing the HDMI cable. So that can be really annoying if you don't have the cable and then you got a run rich around the office trying to find another cable or something where you can connect. So that would be one thing that is a bit of a pet fee. Thank you.",6.0
"So the average person takes 7500 steps per day, which is essentially the equivalent of 6 kilometers per day, which is pretty interesting actually that um 6 kilometers. I would have thought it was a lot less than that. I would have said maybe one or two kilometers, but six is actually pretty good. I guess this assumes that somebody is walking to work or once they're at work is maybe walking to. For lunch, probably quite a bit less. If you are working from home then I would imagine that you're significantly more sedentary, but six kilometers not bound for the average Joe walking around pretty good. And I guess if you're in a walking city, I'm fortunate to be in a walking city which is Montreal, that's pretty good too.

"So how I ended up in this current role a sensually. I was completely fed up of doing continuous sapt upgrades. And I was working at Deloitte and had the opportunity to go and see the work day demo, and part of the demo included the realization that everyone was on the same version. And from an account. I'm an accountant, a CPA from an accounting perspective. New York not having to update all the time and everyone was on the same version was basically a halilu moment for me. And from that moment on, I really, really wanted to work for a company that use work day finance. And so that to me is made perfect sense. You don't want to keep upgrading all the time and especially after I just gotten off and SAP meaning or upgrade project. Where, after three years, we were told to be. Employment for the next version of Iron Press that was coming out. That we would have to know upgrade to the new version of SIP and that the one that we've just been working on for the last three years was no longer going to be completely. So I applied to work day. I got the job based on the fact that obviously if you're working at work day, work day is going to use their own software. And that was to me the perfect way to ensure that I would be working with work day and with SAP. Anymore on these non-stop presentation? So that is it. Thank you.",4.0
"Alright, so this video will be on how to make my kids favorite food. So um, this is something that my kids asked me to make all the time. I call it yellow past them because when they were just little they couldn't pronounce carbon ever. But basically it's ah carbanara cheese pasta. So how to make this is first you have to cut up some pancetta. Which is an Italian style with bacon, and put that in the pan has to be kind of fairly finely, and when you're at the store or ordering the pancetta, you want it a little bit thicker, so not too too thin, a little bit thicker. Cut that up, put them in the frying pan. While you're doing that, you can also boil the water for your pasta. I use penne pasta, but you can basically use any kind of pasta while your pancetta is frying up once it gets a little bit more. Crispy at that point. What I do is I add some asparagus, so this peragus I cut up to about the same size as the penny. This is just for looks, so it'll kind of looks the same. Cut that up, add that to the mix, throw in some pepper as well, and at that point I also cut up some fresh thyme and putting down in the recipe as well, and previously I'd have. Cooked up some chicken to use, so I thinly sliced the check-in. Throw all that in for the carbanara sauce. What you want to do is have 25 mils of cream per person. Have that in a separate bowl. Also. Take some eggs, crack those and just remove the yolk but that in and then add cheese. Throw all that into the pen and I am at a time so I will stop there.",6.0

"Everyone does. So this is how I got into my position currently at work day. I began my career about seven years ago in consulting for BIG4 working under a different system. After a couple of years there, I expanded my network and actually had a few folks thought I was close with working out of work day and they really sold me on the culture and the innovation as well as the team. So after a few years doing the traditional management consulting, I moved over to work day and you know, immediately really got immersed in. And the culture, the community, how we do things and and really the work that core values. You know, going into work day I started off as a power consultant, didn't really have a desire to go into leadership at first.

About 16 months ago, I actually had an opportunity to move into a leadership position. To be honest, it was a bit earlier than I was expecting, however. I jumped up a chance and went through the interview process and. Was a successful candidate and actually ended up becoming consulting manager. Since then I've built out um.

Energy cells to make sure that your party has enough energy to properly recover water in itself is not enough. It's certainly important. However, you're going to need certain pieces such as Salter, Um. Actual carbohydrates or fats and proteins to actually help rebuild certain things within your body. The soreness is really built upon the breaking down of certain muscle fibers, so I'm sure you maintain a steady diet, even small caloric surplus. In terms of sleep and movement.

"Hi there. My name is Audra Cadwallader and I like to share with you my favorite dish to make for my family. It is spaghetti and I used to use sausage and ground beef as the the meat base or their protein base. But then I changed to ground Turkey and I found that a lot of times there's not a whole lot of flavor in the ground Turkey. So I simmer infused olive oil. Sometimes I use basil infused olive oil, other times I use oregano. Or garlic infused olive oil, a little bit of roasted garlic, and then I put some additional spices as well as tomato paste that I get from a tube that you can reuse and put in the refrigerator. So I make my base in my Dutch oven, and then I add in the ground Turkey. By doing so, then you're infusing those spices, the infused olive oil, all of those, into the flavor of the meat before you start generating your sauce. And while you're while your noodles are spaghetti noodles or fettuccine noodles or then spaghetti Angel hair pasta. Before those are ah to boil point in your in your other pot. So after I get all of that simmered and it's it's done to a consistency that I like, then I kind of turn it to low for the time being. I take my noodles out and I had drained those noodles in the sink and I add salt and pepper and garlic and parmesan cheese while they're still hot and so that the salt and the pepper and everything sticks to the noodles. Then I add in the noodles and then finally I add in the sauce with additional spices.

Ah, the sights and the sounds of Portland ME are quite remarkable. There's the coast. We took our son at a very young age on a lobster fishing expedition. We fished out the lobsters from the Nets. We were educated on the differences between how to determine if a lobster is a female versus a male. And we also were able to take our catches up to the restaurant when we docked back and have that as a lobster boil out, overlooking the water and everything. We also went to Cape Elizabeth and it was breathtaking to see the lighthouse and be up on the mountain. We also went to a farm and enjoyed playing with the animals and seeing the apple orchard.",

"OK, so I'm going to teach you how to cook my favorite food, which is tacos. So tacos are great, uh, basically due to their simplicity. Super easy really can be. It's super flexible. It can be whatever you want it to be. So we'll start first with ingredients will go into what you need to do to cook it, prepare it, eat it. So ingredients realbasic. All you need are tortillas and something to put in them what you put in them. Usually it's meat doesn't have to be meet. There can be lots of other things you put on top of it or it could be nothing. It could just be meeting tortillas. Those are some of the best ones I've ever had. Um. Meat, beef, chicken, fish, um. Had sheep brain. Wouldn't recommend that necessarily. Could go vegetarian, you know, really can be whatever you want. Um, some people like to add other things like lettuce or sprinkled lime juice on it. Onion, salsa, cream cheese, what have you. It's really up to your personal taste. So you gotta pull all these ingredients together. Whatever you want to add in there to prepare it. Really the only thing you need to cook is meat. So based on whatever meat you're having, that's. That's, you know, follow the guidelines how to cook it. You want to season it? Um. Lots of different choices for that Google recipe. Um, you don't have to season it. I do. Usually at least some salt. If nothing else, make sure your meat is through thoroughly cooked. You want it to be safe for everyone to eat. I usually take the meat, put it all in one bowl, put all the different ingredients in separate bowls, heat up the tortillas in the microwave. Um, there's other ways to do it. I prefer a small corn tortillas and and really just lay the whole spread out on the table. He let people build to taste so they can assemble their own tacos. Take it tortilla, put the stuff in that.

"Hello, my name is Dan Hummel, and I'm going to tell you about how I like to make my favorite food, which is a rib eye steak on the grill. So first important thing is to purchase a good sized steak. That is, I'd say 12 to 16 ounces. You don't want to go any smaller than that. I prefer to buy a piece of steak that is over an inch in the raw state. Then you want to unwrap and put the seasoning on it several hours before you want to cook it. The benefit there is you can have the salt be absorbed into the meat and provide that. Seasoning you want to have. I prefer like a Montreal steak seasoning. Then be my. Preferred if you're if you're new to this. Then when it's about time to do the cooking, you want to open up the grill and take a, um, paper cloth, paper towel with some olive oil or vegetable oil and just kind of rub that on all the grades, the grill, and that'll add that nice grill marks. So you went on the steak. From there, you will heat up the grill 25 or 600 degrees to get nice and hot. When that's hot, then you put the steak on and it allows it to sear the bottom surface and keep all the all the juice moisture in. Which is preferred? Then you'll let it cook there. You'll back off the heat a little bit so that it's not flaring up or anything, and you allow it to cook until it's about 110 degrees with the thermometer. You will then flip it. And you only really want to flip it once and then get the internal temperature up to about 130 degrees. After that, let it rest and you should be ready to go in about 5 minutes after that.

Um, from there I had some opportunities to learn more about engineering in different roles, like the Honda of America Engine Co-op where I learned about how to. Work in automobile engines and testing, which was a very valuable experience and hands on with Honda Accord engines and the different rigorous engine testing that they go through before they are rolled out in production. And after that I had one more internship where I was at even flow baby seed company where I was designing some of the components that they have in the car seats, the plastic mold injection and designing with different tools like. CAD tools. So it was very valuable, valuable experience for design. After that, I had a series of UM jobs here at GE after I graduated in 2004. And um was designing components on the exterior parts of the engine called configurations, the tubes and the pipes that. Kerry? Air and fuel and oil. I had a valuable experience after that hardware ownership job, moving over to preliminary design where I could learn about how the whole system works together in a preliminary design stage, which is before concept.

"Bring to everyone's notice that the thing that I did differently to get into this job was, I mean I was getting into a comfort zone into my previous job and that was the point when I took up this one. So this was an experiment for me as well and. Just to describe a little more, so in 2019 I had taken up the role of warehousing and logistics and as the scenario in every warehouse the parts were missing. There were huge variances which were running into thousands of dollars an. The delivery from the lines were very much delayed, so we had an OT of approximately 14 to 17% if we go by the system records. However, we started working on building up the people skills setting in the right discipline for the operations in warehousing and. The most important part that we did was to motivate the people to take pride in the job they do and that is what I believe set the tone for us to move towards the benchmarking in the warehousing role. So while we move the needle from 4014 to 90% in OTD and the inventory accuracy is also started moving from 92% to 99% by the end of 2021. So finally executed all these activities or silently. I was also honing my skills on operations. So basically operational leadership I would say like keeping the people safe. Then developing people skills and.

After pouring the water, you can plant some cabomba or water lilies into it and then allow the water to settle in. Once the water starts settling down, I'm in, the dust settles down then putting their anti chlorine solution into the water so that this removes the chlorine and which is good for the fishes. After you do this then take few gravels and driftwood which would add to the natural aesthetic for creating a pond inside the pan. Once you've done that, then. Uh, I mean, the driftwood that you have placed in that also acts as a natural head out for all the solitary fish is that you want to take in. And I like better fighters. Those like to remain solidly.

"So I'm going to tell you how to change the oil in your car. So the first step is to make sure that you go by the correct oil. Based on the manufacturers recommendation you can usually find this in the manual of the car. The next step is to start the car and let it run for awhile to get the oil up to a good warm temperature so that it will drain out easier. The next after that, you Jack the car up in the air and put some Jack stands underneath to make sure that there's you know that the car is safe in case one of the Jacksons falls or fails, and then make sure that you crawl underneath and remove the drain plug at the base of the oil of the oil pan. Let the oil drain into some kind of container or catch basin for the oil and let it drain out for 10 or 15 minutes. You can also at that time remove the oil filter and catch any oil that comes out with it from the old oil filter. Then you. You go back and you replace the oil filter with a new one. I like to fill it up with some oil first to make sure that the oil filter is. It doesn't when the engine starts, isn't just empty. And then you so you screw that back in. You replace the oil drain plug. Usually there's a crush washer that goes on on on that that is used to help seal that connection point. So use that. Torque the bolt down to the recommended torque setting within the manual also. And then at that point you can fill the engine up with oil with the recommended amount of oil. Again, the specs for how much oil to add to an engine for an oil change should be listed in the manual, and once that's done. Check the level with the oil dipstick and make sure it's within the safe range.",3.0

"If you tried. Googling. Most important, people in history. Try it. You will get most likely only men, or for the most part. So if you're a decision maker. How much would you trust? You know, how would you explain such such a result if you were to look at a business dashboard data today? Is like oil in the 21st century. It's an immensely valuable but untapped asset. Today, data engineering suffers from mainly 3 pain points. You have brittle data pipelines, you have lack of trust and quality in the data, and you have poor maintenance. Hello, my name is Mary and I'm the CEO of IBM Consulting data platform services. So by and large. Software engineering has solved these problems. By introducing seek pipeline, DevOps observability, unit testing, data quality checks. However, data is different. It's more complex. It has weight. And solving these problems is possible with today's technologies, but it's a bit more involved and require some thinking. Isn't it about time though that we introduce ways to fix data problems by structuring the thinking about data engineering differently? If you are serious about trying to fix your data trust issues.

So let me talk about that first. Death. Cyclops is the capability to consistently deliver secure quality code to different environments and production, and it relies on other nation of repetitive tasks. Um to have and to build a successful death Cyclops implementation um you need two key factors. One eh is at the environment that's a robust environment and 2nd is the um keeping and this environment operational. So let me walk you through that eh um. So building this step Cyclops environment is very critical and I said as I mentioned earlier and. To do so, you need to have lists of tools that would be integrated together. So these are like the toolchain which we call them as Cicd pipeline. Um, you would need to. It cultural changes needs to be happening between developers and operators and also new skill set. This is like building as smart the smart home and IoT home. You will need that Google device, you need the smart light bulb and you need to have everything integrated and secure with password or other things.

"Do you? Ever think about sustainability in your semiconductor development? Oh, microprocessors have billions of transistors. They can have more states than we have atoms in the whole universe. How do we verify these? We take all existing compute power that we have and just. Simulate whatever we can. That's not really sustainable, so I'll show you three ways how to save energy and become more sustainable #1. Optimize your performance #2. Go where you didn't go before #3. Harvest your fruits. Now #1 optimized performance. Your testbench can be poorly coded. There's alot of things where you can save a lot of save alot of time running faster by optimizing your structures. You're performance critical code so you don't spend so much time in your testbench. #2. What you do is go where you didn't go before. You use functional coverage. You can see the events. You can save energy by just. Taking the test case, just taking the test cases that you have. The most efficient one and created bucket out of it and just concentrate on these and then the third one that should really complete the picture is go where you didn't go before. So. He run functional coverage again, you'll see where you didn't go before. You go into areas where you have low coverage and then use automated mechanism, use AI or use analysis in order to go where you didn't go before. But if you do these three things, you get much more sustainable by saving energy. But remember, right, I mean as it as if you go on a hike, right? You got your backpack, it's gotta be you make everything that it's lighter, but then you fill your pockets and you put stones in your backpack.

Get about a small avocado or 1/2 of a large avocado or 4 ounces of guacamole and then the third ingredient is homeless. That chick peas and and and sesame seed gives you some smooth creaminess as well as giving you some protein. You chop up the Greens as fine as you can or maybe maybe 1/2 inch to quarter inch in size. Chop it up, put it into a bowl. Mix in the guacamole, avocado and the homeless. Stir it up and that becomes a great dip for your vegetables. It becomes and you can add other things to it, like I like to put in some chopped Chili Peppers, some chopped onions, and maybe even some cilantro and some. Um, ginger, even chopped ginger.

Yes, you heard it right, it's called Lotus Seeds and as the name shows, it's come from the Lotus plant. Many of the people doesn't know it, but it's one of the way the healthiest seeds out there. It's full of healthy nutrients, antioxidants. It helps you with sleep disorder. And a lot more. So let's jump onto the recipe. It's a very quick recipe. And store it for a long time in airtight container and you can just snack it anytime you like. So to begin with, you want to take a small bowl, um, put some butter in its salt, pepper. You can even use paprika if you want, depending on the spice levels. And also the butter depends on how much of buttery snack you want. Just add them all together, mix it up, put it on the side, then take a, you know, a heavy bottom pan. Heat it up on a medium heat and once it's a little bit you know it's just a little bit hot. Just put all the seeds from the packet right in there and then start roasting. This is the longer part of the whole process. Just keep roasting for about like 10/2 I would select 10 to 15 minutes and it should turn into a little bit more like a crunchy and the color would start changing a little bit. Brownish texture E and that's when you want to put this. Go ahead and put the mixture. That we just mix it in the bowl, mix it up and then after, you know, gotta give good mix and then keep roasting it for another 5 to 10 minutes.

"One big thing that I have planned for my team, it's not only ensured that they're receiving consistent professional development, but it's also to make sure that each of them ends up with a full time opportunity, or at least full time internship opportunity that allows them to take the next step in their career. Uh, a lot of our team, our computer science or computer game science or even education majors. And so they're doing something kind of aligned with their bigger goal, but it's not. Exactly the next step and so supporting them to make sure that they're getting to that point is going to be the biggest goal that I have for the rest of my team. I also want to make sure that they're developing just good professionalism skills so that when they're in that role, not only are they proficient, but they're also just good employees and teammates, which does come with some support like performance improvement plans or even performance management where it's just making sure you consistently opening your program on time or consistently. Making your shifts also hoping that they'll be really great team members since not only do they work in small pod groupings, but they also have development opportunities where they work in even smaller teams.

"Hi, insert name here. I really appreciate you taking some time to just chat about some of the performance goals that we're going to set and talk about basically what is eventually evolving into you. This written warning as you know a couple of things, you know that you're a great counselor, um, you always have great feedback from parents and families, but I just want to make sure that that other side outside of the teaching and kind of facilitating with the programs is that we're also being super professional. Just because it does impact a lot of different teams in parties when you are late or you don't communicate that you won't be able to make a shift. And so you can see that on these three dates you were late to start a program and on this one date you were also what's technically called a no show. Because of that you are receiving this morning. And I do just want to walk through the teams that were affected each of these times. So not only does support have to take time to message each family, but we also had to process refunds in cancel a program. Because you were X amount of minutes late, which means that this technically counts as a no show moving forward. I really just want to make sure that not only are you communicating when you're unable to make a shift, but you're also prioritizing that time management piece to ensure that you are making those shifts. As I said before, I know you're a great counselor. I know you're fully capable of doing this because I've seen it before, and because of that, because we are trust that we've hired a great team of counselors. This will sunset after three months, so if there's no other incidents within 3. Once this essentially falls off of that record and you'll start back over basically at level one in terms of warnings. But if this does continue to be a problem, will really dive into that performance improvement plan and see what we can do to just push you to be a bit better. Because we really don't want to have a conversation around letting you go.

When we have, it had been proven by research over the world that when we have more women. In leadership positions. There are bringing different perspectives and therefore bringing different ideas, and the companies are more innovative and of course, financially more performing. This is not me that I'm saying that. You can look at the statistics and all the research that had been done. The companies with women in leadership, more women in leadership roles have a better per financial performance.

It's difficult to find the talents that we that we need. And women are 50% of the world. We cannot afford to not look at this. Huge potential of of young women.

"If you ordered a bag of coffee off of Amazon and there was a giant gaping hole in the bag, would you be happy with your purchase? I know that I wouldn't. Back failures are one of the most common packaging problems that we observe in our end. This is a big issue when we're talking about sterile products, because with a sterile product, we need to ensure that our product is clean and sterile for our customers. With sterile products, we need to ensure that there is no bioburden or outside contamination on the product. Designing packaging that ensures that we have a double sterile barrier or essentially 2 layers of packaging around our product will ensure that what developing is going to meet our customers needs. One method of doing that is by developing 3D bags. By utilizing 3D bags we can take a 3 dimensional object and really ensure that our bag conforms to our product. This ensures that we're not going to get defects where the film would be double folded. So if you picture taking a bag and folding it in One Direction and then again in another direction, you will end up with what we call a starmark. Now a star Mark can easily become a failure if it comes into contact with any hard surface. By using a 3D bag, we can again eliminate these star marks because instead of having to fold the film and multiple multiple directions around our product, now instead it conforms to our product. This enables us to have a packaging design that again will get our product safely to our customers.",8.0

In order to mitigate packaging failures, we can design 3D bags which conform to the shape of our product. It eliminate those areas where we have double folds of the material.

"Have you ever wanted to learn more about birds? I wouldn't be surprised if you answered this question with uh, no.

Wingspan is my personal favorite game because it contains beautiful artwork. Lots of different strategies that you can pursue and at the end uh really cohesive game with a great experience. The game is also available as an app if you prefer to learn digitally rather than reading the physical rulebook. Wingspan is laid across 3 rounds. In the first round of the game. You will be building up your board of birds and trying to get as much synergy going as possible. Each round has its own specific. Goal that you're working towards. At the end of the round, that bonus will score. And you get the opportunity to earn some points as you play birds, you'll have to pay their cost in food, and the birds in turn will give you special abilities that will enable you to advance further in the game. When you get to the last round of the game, the game will end, and at that point scoring will occur in order to gain points. Each bird will have its own specific point value. This total will be added to your total that you earned in bonus categories throughout the other rounds of the game. There are other ways to earn points as well, such as collecting food, putting cards behind birds, and also playing predatory birds, which can eat other birds, insects, rodents, etc. Throughout the game. At the end of the round, the player with the most points wins. Ties are broken by the player that has the most food. Wingspan offers 2 expansions to add additional content to your game and give you varied experiences by utilizing different birds, different strategies and adding more players to the game.

"Hi everyone myself by three. I've been with G for the past or 10 plus years and I would really like love to share one success story or like a very sweet thing which happened in the recent past like close to 12 months. So basically I work on the. Design and change space in the aviation engineering side and I was given an opportunity to make a shift from the design and change space to aviation test domain. So this was a big shift and I just wanted I just use this opportunity to come out of my comfort zone and build everything from the scratch. So learning about the new domain was definitely a big challenge and I was able to do my best to it and currently I work as a tech lead and so I worked with. The execution leader to build the team from the scratch to kind of short list the. Team members and since they were all new to GE, we did all the correct and the adequate training for them to get on board with the right skill set. So this was a big challenge. I mean, this was the first time for me to start everything from the scratch, so definitely starting from there. And then I was able to give them the opportunity to talk, come out with their ideas and improve the user experience as well as the design. So there was an open culture. Created so that the team members were able to deliver things right on time and the product was also well very well received and we were appreciated at the CIO level for the good work done. So in short, I what I would like is not just one person or collaboration, but it, I mean I was fortunate enough to work with a very vibrant set of use team and bring the best out of them.

Then you fire the owner and you cook it. And you're slightly dry the audience and then you put it inside the post to the riser. You toast it a little bit till it becomes with the color of yellow and brownish color. And then you can put inside half glass of wine and you make the high quality operated to give the the rise some flavor.

Hi, my name is Frank Bruni from IBM Cloud engineering and let me explain you what application resource management is all about and how your business could benefit from it. Let's first use an analogy to retailers supply chain and let's take a product this apple. The prophet of retailers largely depend on their supply chain and how well it is optimized, which optimization they can avoid to scroll way uppers. They also can ensure that they always have apples on their shelves to avoid missing cells. And guess what? This optimization has to go fast so that Apple always fresh and tasty. Like consumers, your applications expect on time delivery of just enough cloud resources or computing power from your data center. Optimizing these supply chain is what application resource management, ER, EMM is all about and in this modern world with the growing complexity of application. The diversity of hybrid cloud environment in which you have to deploy them. And the viability of the demand. It's impossible to do this optimization manually.

"Do you ever get really nervous when you're about to have a dinner party? Would you like a really easy and simple way to impress your guests? Well, if you would listen to the next few minutes of this video and I'm going to teach you how to make fresh tortillas. It sounds very simple, but for some reason people are very impressed when you make your own fresh fruity's. And to be honest, they're they're a lot better tasting as well. So what? So how do we make fresh Shorty is there are three steps to making fresh tortillas. The first one is you need to mix the ingredients. The second one is you need to press the tortillas and the third one is, is that you fry the tortillas. It's really that simple. So first get some good Mesa, some good corn meal from the grocery store. It is definitely better to use organic and a higher quality Mesa. You then basically mix about, it says right on the package, which you need, but it's it's basically a couple cups of the Mesa and about 1/2 a cup of water. It's better if you heat the water a little bit too above room temperature. You mix the ingredients until you get into your dough can form a ball. Once your dough can form a ball, put it in a ball and then leave it for about 15 minutes to rest. Very simple. After you do that, you're going to roll your dough into about 16 um smaller balls, um, and you just you'll leave those and then it's time to prepare your press so it's you can, in stores you can. Quite often find tortilla presses. They're quite inexpensive, but in a pinch I've used plates. I've used cutting boards. There's lots of ways to do it, but the press is definitely a little bit easier. When you're using the press, they're usually some type of metal, and it's best to wrap Saran wrap above around both the top and the bottom so that your tortillas don't stick to the press itself. And I find that you need to do that if you use a cutting board or plate as well, once you. Take your ball and you stick it in the middle of the year, press, and then you close the press, and then you press down pretty hard and your total will come out about this thick, and that's really all you want. If you're using a plate or using a cutting board, it's good to also use sort of a rolling forward motion to do that. Once you have, um, done, let's say four to six of your tortillas, um, you could start to fry them, and while they're frying you can then go back and press out the remaining. Pretty is frying them does not take very long. I just do it on a hot cast iron griddle. I don't you don't need any oil, you don't need any butter. Um, you just lay them on that cast iron at about you at high heat, and after about a minute you'll notice that they start to rise up a little bit and get some bubbles in them, and that's a good indication that you're almost done. Once you start to see a few of those bubbles forming, you simply flip it over. Um, usually you'll see a little bit of Browning um at that point. On the on the back, it's a nice golden color. Do the other side and then once you've done the other side, you're basically done and you have fresh tortillas which you could put your favorite toppings on.

"When people are asked to give their opinion about PDP, there's one thing that comes up the most often. Does anyone in the room know what that is? Well, the answer is simple. Quite often the answer is, is that we do deliverables that don't add any valuable value to our process, and there's a workstream called PDP flexibility that is addressing that. You might be surprised to know that the purpose of this workstream is not to promote the idea of doing as few deliverables as possible. The purpose of the Workstream, the goal of the work stream, if you will, is really so that at the end of the project. If asked the question. What deliverables or activities did you work on that did not add any value to the project? The answer is none. And so the way we're doing this within the PDP flexibility WORKSTREAM is we've developed a checklist of all of the deliverables. Unlike past checklist, we really we list exactly what the purpose and the value that we're expecting to get out of each deliverable is, and we highlight who in the organization. Really benefits from that deliverable. Because remember, not every organization, every function is going to benefit from every deliverable. But sometimes you have to participate in creating deliverables that benefit another organization, and they do the same for you. So at the end of this workstream when it's rolled out and we have change management, again, I'm not looking, I'm not hoping that people will be like we don't we eliminated 17 deliverables, but I'm really hoping for is, is that people will say we did 0 deliverables that added note that that added no value and all the deliverables that we did do added value to the project. Thank you.",5.0
"I'd like to explain to you what the purpose of our PDP flexibility WORKSTREAM is. It is not an attempt to get people to reduce to a bare minimum the number of deliverables. The main purpose is that when we're done with the project or part of the project, that everybody on the team is in agreement that the only deliverables or activities that they worked on are ones that added value to someone or some part of the organization. The way we're going to do that is we're developing a checklist that highlights for each deliverable exactly what the value is to the organization and who in the organization benefits from it. And that way the core team can either go through it at the beginning of a phase or before they start a particular deliverable, and make sure that the the deliverable itself really will add value for that particular project. And if it doesn't, not do it. Thank you.",5.0
"Hello everyone and thank you for taking the time to listen to a 'cause that's very important to me and I hope it will be important to you. I'd like today. I'd like to talk about the Bangor Y and before I go on, I know that there are a lot of worthy worthy. Institutions out there that are in need of money, many, many causes that are in need of money, and I know that you in particular, are often asked to contribute to these many to these many causes. The reason that I think the bangle why is one of the. Causes that you should consider is that it really allows kids to be themselves. It teaches them how to. Two, through positive role models, it teaches them how to feel confident and be leaders in the world. And because people like you have contributed in the past, where you quite often able to provide that kind of service without financial burden to the families. Not that long ago, my own child, about 12 or 13 years ago, I went to leaders school for the first time and he basically spent the entire week crying, or at least the first half of the week crying because he was nervous that he wouldn't fit in. He was nervous that he wouldn't be able to get through. Challenged, eh. He was nervous about the food that they were serving, pretty much everything. And at the end of the week, he still didn't realize that he had such a positive experience, but sometime during the winter. He was thinking about it obviously internally, and in the end he decided that now that he understood what was going on, he really wanted to go back and he thought he would have a good time. It's been 13 years now and he's been, uh was a counselor all through the junior high and high school program, and now he's been a counselor for the last four or five years. So I ask you to remember what it was like for you to be a young teenager. Perhaps you were feeling insecure, and now how you can help others avoid that same insecurity. And I ask you to give to the Bangor Roy.",4.0

"Do you like hot let? I love hatchet. So now let me tell you how you can make the perfect Hackett. According to me. Sounds pretty simple. Few ingrediant, pretty basic. And that's why where you gonna shop matters so much. Quality in Hackett is everything. So let's start with the cheese. Hack it to main component of the racket after it's called so for raclette, for the cheese. I usually go to informally. Don't buy in supermarket. Really focus on a nice home, Ashley, once you get there. I would usually take the option of. Two or maybe three different type of hybrid so you can really experience different flavor. I'm a quantity standpoint. Always go above excellent raclette. It's just um can be eaten without any appetite. Mobley is also really nice alternative. So if you take two different type of racket, Bobby can be a really nice compliment as a search is. So now let's move to Shaqiri, which I would consider as maybe the second more most important ingredient, as a regret. So here's the same thing. Go to the butcher. Don't go to the supermarket. At the butcher I think diversity is really important, so I would definitely maybe take about 5 different option of meat. So you can really have different taste. And I would also advise to get them slice very thin so you can really get to try um. All five option as you're eating. Combination of pork and beef is my preference. Um, I would really recommend Bisola in addition to traditional kind of white ham as well as Parma ham. So now, um, maybe one thing that is a little bit more specific to me is that I really enjoy um vegetable with regrets. Not the most common, especially for a French person. Very pretty does make a difference. You make it a lot more digestible and again it kind of allowed to mix flavor to taste. So I would say from there you can have like mushroom, onions, pepper, tomato. Ah, those are really nice. Buy them nice and premium. Um, in a very nice supermarket and and view is even better. And finally of course you by your potato, which is obviously so third base ingredient. That's about it and I wish you but happy.",4.0

"Do you want our business to grow faster? Do you want to foster innovation? Do you want Mac to be the best place to work? Do you want to beat competition?

We are not going to change the world in one day. But there is at least one thing that we can do together as a team and I really would like us moving forward to focus on our recruiting process and make sure it's completely unbiased and there is very simple technique that we can apply to ensure these. And implemented. So couple of things. Number one, we need to ensure that there is a panel of candidates that is diverse. It starts with that. We need to make sure that the pool of candidate of course is diverse as well and that means looking at people internally as well as externally mixed gender, nationality, personality, experience, background, skin color, you name it. Then you bring those and we also need to make sure that we can compare Apple to Apple, removing biased again. How do you do that? You make sure that you have a list of questions, that is. Uniform and that you as the same thing to every candidate. So when you bring it all together, then you can really ensure that you're comparing. Apple to Apple and then make a fair decision.

"How many of you wonder what that long horizontal machine is with the fan on it at the gym? How many of you wonder how to use it and what is it? It's a rowing machine. My name is Susie Clute and I'm here to teach you about rowing. Some of the first steps that you need to know are three individual elements that you need to control while, ER, rowing. There is your legs in the leg press. Your core in how you lean back. And your arms breaking it down. Those are the three simple things that you need to know. Let's start backwards. First, let's focus on your arms. How you want, uh row is. You want to be flat across the wrists. You don't want to be doing any turns like this up or down. If you're in the water, that's when you want to turn your wrist, because what you're doing is you'll be feathering the blade on the water to catch as you go and then get it out of the water before you drop it in. But let's first start with the arms you want to bring it in. All the way to your rib cage. So starting focused here, pull your arms out, pull um in. You want to pull with your laps, so the first thing you want to do is kind of lean back a little bit, right on your sits, bones. Engage your core and justice. Practice your arms. Just practice in and out, in and out. The next thing that you bring in is your body, your core. Breach that forward just enough to give you a little bit of a pivot. As you're going up, you'll realize when you lean forward, your body will start to slide towards the fan. As you get up to the front, your arms will be out, you'll go as far as you possibly can, and then you catch. At this point you're catching the water you pull, but what you're pulling with? Is your legs. You are pushing off the fan with your likes. Push as far as you can. You push, then bring your body back, and then your arms, and then do it the opposite way, arms, body, and then bring your legs up, slow and steady. You wanna make sure that you have a consistent pace. They call those strokes per minute. If you're a novice and you're beginning and you're just trying to get a workout, 18 to 20 strokes per minute is a great pace for an for an aerobic workout. You want to keep this consistent. You want to push your legs, move your core, pull with your arms as quickly as you can, and then slowly come back up to the catch. The reason you do that is because you don't want the boat to go back and forth. You want to glide with the boat. Imagine you're in the water, then you catch and pull. So now you know how to rope, and you don't have to be that person at the gym that your trainer comes and says you're gonna hurt your back. You're not going to because you know how to row now. Thank you.",7.0

This situation would particularly benefit adolescent girls, who are at increased risk for medical complications associated with pregnancy and who are often forced to make compromises in education and employment that may lead to poverty and a lower educational attainment. Contraception has clear benefits, since the prevention of unintended pregnancies result in a subsequent decrease in maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. Providing access to all women in developing countries who currently have an unmet need would prevent nearly 55. Unintended pregnancies. And 16 million would be unsafe abortions.

"So today I want to talk about collaborating as a team. Working as a team is very important and it's very critical to the success. I would like to share that true what I've done in my role previously as a few service engineer. So as a few service engineer, I was supporting our GNX product at Cathay Pacific, our one of our big customer. My role is to support them through issues and keep the fleet flying. As you may know, with every airline flying there is risk in a chance of engine having an issue. So imagine you're an airplane flying to your back with application to San Francisco, and midway through the flight the pilot goes on the PA system and says due to technical issue, the plane is diverting to Alaska. Beside the fact that Alaska is extremely cold, they have very limited. Fleet support, maintenance, support, or even any kind of crew support. In that place, the imagine the pain, the frustration that the passengers, the crew and even the allies to true when an engine has an issue on our fleet. Typically this is when the allied will approach the few service team to get support and this is where collaboration is very important. Typically the airline will come to us first and we as a G team will work together to help them to resolve the issues. I typically take on the role as a technical coordinator with the product support engineering team. Again and my other colleagues will take on the communication rule with the customer. And we would have another person as a team to take on the communication with our G internal leadership team because typically the the leadership would want to know what's happening and how they can support the customer. Communication within our team and the customer is very important. And that is the key to the successful collaboration working policy. As a team, we saw we have solved many issues.

I really recommend Prong because it goes really well with these spaghetti. Next comes the cooking step, which is really the set to cook the spaghetti in boiling water. Add some salt into the boiling water to give it a bit of taste. Heat up the pan with some oil while you're waiting for the spaghetti to cook. And gently saute the garlic to justice. Light golden brown color and when that's ready, er, spaghetti should also be ready. And then you put the prawns and scallops or any other sequel they want to saute on the frying pan until they're golden Brown as well. And last but not least, by then the spaghetti will be ready and through the right softness and you can drain out the water. Put the spaghetti into the pen and justice. Stir fry it for couple minutes to taste. And finally, it's the flavoring pot, right? Put in the parsley basil that you had prepared earlier and put in some sort to give it flavor. Again, tree simple steps, preparation, cooking, and flavoring.",4.0

"Gartner estimates that about four and a half trillion dollars will be spent in 2022 on it across the world, but only about 500 billion of that, or less, little over 10% is going to be spent in the cloud. Why is that? Well, imagine you're the CEO of a large multinational bank and you spent years and millions or billions of dollars building IT infrastructure that has the performance, security and reliability that your bank needs in order to get the advantages of cloud. The problem is that most cloud solutions, sorry. I'll rephrase it. Most cloud vendors they approached, they're designed for cloud native applications, meaning applications that are designed specifically to take advantage of cloud features to get those security, reliability and performance requirements. They use scaling across multiple data centers and load balancers, what have you and you're being told by most of these cloud vendors said the way that you can update your existing legacy systems is to re platform or re architect, which is essentially a fancy way of saying tear down what you've got and rebuild it again in cloud native techniques. That's like saying that somebody like me who's got a 40 year old house that they. Love Beautiful View House pictures of their kids, only life in the neighborhood that they enjoy in order to get the new features of the houses that are building out that with entertainment centers or different or different colored appliances in order to get them and have to tear down that house and rebuild it. And that makes no sense. So that's why IBM Cloud has a different approach. Our focus is on hybrid multicloud infused with AI and each of those really matters, but in particular focus on hybrid for the day, hybrid says what we can do is tie together combinations of legacy solutions or multi Cloud says solutions that you've got in another in another cloud vendor. And build them and modernize them with features that are provided by our cloud to get an overall better solution. So for example you can take your mainframe application and leave it on Prem or you can take your power solution and leave it on Prem or migrate into our cloud because we have enterprise system support for things like main framing and power in our system. You can take your leave it here, move it to our cloud solution vendor of a different thread, different company and that's all fine. That's what hybrid multi cloud means. So that's like saying if you want to modernize your existing front existing infrastructure. You can modernize it through hybrid multi cloud, just like if you're trying to modernize the house, you're going to paint or replace appliances, you're not going to tear it down and rebuild it entirely from scratch. And I think when we as an industry adopt hybrid multi cloud is the basic way of working with enterprise is when will increase that $500 billion capture we have now, um or something close to that 4 1/2 trillion that is being spent each year.

The first one if is 51 billion, the second one is zero. 51 billion is how many tons of CO2 sore, green houses gases are emitted by human activities in the atmosphere every year, and 0 is what is what we need to hang for. So we need to have a net zero value in. Set himself emissions of green gas houses. Two, in order to stop global warming and avoid no, um, dangerous effects on climate change. Um, so each time you heard about innovation stability, you have to make yourself a question. How much of the feet 51 billions of? Towns are we talking about?",5.0

Cut those leaks down the long ways of the leak. And then cut them into thin slices so that you've got Half Moon or D shaped pieces, and then you'll take about four tablespoons of butter and put them on the bottom of a thick bottom pan on medium heat. Melt the butter once the butter is melted. You're going to saute the shrimp for 3-4 minutes until the shrimp are no longer raw. Then you'll remove those from Japan, but those on a plate leaving the. The juices in the pan sauce. Then put the leaks in the pan. Saute them for probably four or five minutes until they soften. And then you're going to add 2 cans of white beans, like a Great Northern bean or cannelini bean, and two cups of chicken or vegetable stock. Bring that to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for five to 10 minutes until it thickens. If you wanted to thicken more, you can smash the beans and mix it up and it'll make a nice, relatively thick sauce.

"Hi so I recently completed an Ironman and Ironman is a 140.6 race consisting of 2.4 mile swim, eh 112 mile bike ride and a 26.2 mile run also known as a marathon. Now people always ask Katie what do you eat when you do an Ironman? And so I respond with this. Um, the first thing you have to think about when preparing for an Ironman is how do you prepare and what do you eat before you race? So first thing in the morning for me is breakfast. We start with some oatmeal and then followed by a banana. These are two things that are easy for my stomach to digest. They don't hurt my stomach and they have me ready to go for the swim. Now when I get out of the swim I like to have something that's a little more substance and this is something that I ate so it's a protein bar. This consists of both protein and carbs, around 20 grams of carbs to get me ready for the bike ride. Now while on the 112 mile bike ride I used this custom blend mixed with water and this custom blend his around 66 grams of carbs. Per serving.

So I started off on a team called the Foundation Tenant service team. So. What I did was data conversion workbooks and in face with the customer doing customer service and after I did that for about 2 years I moved into a project management all where we would take on a lot of customers all at once and had a short time frame to build their first initial tenant in in work day. After doing that for four years, I wanted to progress and move on into a role that would expand my horizons and my skill set. So I was so excited and went forward to take on a role called the test manager. As test manager, what I would do is be able to travel on site, help a customer plan and get ready for the test phase of their implementation. So I would walk them through the. Project planning, the UM preparation, identifying roles, creating test scenarios and then I would project manage the whole test cycle to make sure they would complete all their testing.

And then we also do is cut up a green pepper, chopped that into fine pieces you don't want. Large chunks in your meat. So then I add that the green pepper also to the the mix. After I get that going, I take my favorite sauce which happens to be, um, this Prego garlic spaghetti sauce. So not homemade, but I I grab that, open the bottle, pour that in, mix it, stir, stir it in with the meat and and then cook that down to a simmer and then by the time that is complete you have your water.

It's an airline and part of my job is to make sure they have a good spare balance meaning. They have engines fitted on the aircraft. When exactly do you have to remove those engines? Now if we remove all the engines the same time, that causes. Them to have aircraft without any engines installed. So the aircraft need to stay on the ground, not used until the engines come back. So my job is to make sure that thing does not happen and they have a good spare level. So we're um one engine today and we remove another in a time where we don't need to remove 2 inches at once and. In the last 12 months we I looked at the customers removal plan in the challenges in the way they are going utilizing those aircraft. I realized that.

"How many times? How many of you? You are in a situation where someone hands you their phone and ask you to take a picture of them. And now for those who knows how to take a picture or good as it's maybe this lesson is not for you, but for those who are not confident. To take a picture, so you have a phone. No. Take a picture. All you have to do is point and shoot. But they're not. You're not sure if you know your picture is going to look good or you know. Maybe you are not confident so one of the tricks I do, um, easy beginner tricks that I tell people all the time. When you take a picture, make sure. Think of it of you, whatever you see here, divide it into 2 lines. Or yeah, 2 lines, one horizontal, one in a vertical. Whatever you want to shoot at, make sure it's in the center now the center of focus. So basically what you're trying to do is. You don't want to keep. A big gap on top of the people had. So there's nothing on top, for example, the roof you don't want to be you have the picture 70% only the roof and you know. Only the faces you know, sticking up on top. What you're trying to do is to manage from both sides. So make sure that this there's no enough gap or small gap at that. You know or the picture at the top and enough gap in the bottom and also on the you know both sides. When you do that, just even now you can take your camera and try to shoot anything and try to do that. Specially if you're still taking pictures of people. There is exception if you're trying to take picture of someone with. You have a great, uhhh, landscape behind you. That's the time you know. Make sure the landscape is also appearing. Another tip, make sure the sun, the light source, the sun or light source is not. In the picture, so sometimes. Let's say you have big light shining behind them. You move around or ask them to move around a little bit so that the light source or not hit them. Otherwise it would be a picture not come out good. That's a quick one on how to take a picture.

"Alright, I'm going to be teaching you about alignments and the six degrees of freedom is meterologist. You have to be able to fully constrain your part that you're expecting to get repeatable and reproducible results. That means. There are three axes and three planes that need to be constrained.

Two, we want to rotate it, and you can put imagine pushing that up against the wall. To rotate and prevent it from moving in the second axis. Three, we would want to origin it, and if you imagine a second wall, you could slide that against it. And origin the part. Preventing it from moving it in the third axis. This can fully constrains the part from 6 degrees of freedom, so there's no rotation about each axis or translation about each three planes. This is a fully constrained part which will produce.

My next role after understanding programming, learning programming. I got to work with. A production. Facility that I did high volume programming for. And metrology work. So that was an awesome understanding, an introduction into airfoils. And aviation and. Uhhh grander seem things. And that's where GE aviation peaked my interest and I came to be in my current role as process engineer in metrology for GE Aviation. That's a little bit about myself. Thank you.",4.0

"How I ended up at IBM was through a counselor whose name is Miss March, and she talked about the P tech program. She came to my middle school. And then after that I joined the P tech program. I took some college classes with some friends. And then I failed a couple of classes, had to retake them and I took an internship for IBM. And after waiting some time, I had the opportunity to do this. Which has, which I was really excited about. During the time I was waiting, I. Got a job and it was the worst thing in the world, honestly. They went, went he stand. But I wanted to. I mean sit. Thank. They got messed up. I took too long.",4.0

"I chose how to play a game, and the game I chose was League of Legends. It is a very bad game in my opinion, but I still have a lot of fun with it. It is a 5E5 MOBA which stands for multiplayer online battle arena. It's basically five players on a map just trying to fight each other. And the objective of it is to destroy the enemies. Kind of like final tower, which is called the Nexus. And with each champion, they're called champions, the characters. With each champ comes with four basic attacks. Eh. QAW in er. Are is typically the ultimate. Q is always the one that you want upgrade first, just as the attack you will probably use the most. WS typically utility Andy is a dash. There are things in a game called Summoner Spells which are different from your basic attacks, which are typically on the. D&F key. The most basic ones that you will always see er called Ignite, which will burn the opponent but has a 182nd cooldown. The other one is called Flash which is the most common one which has a 300 seconds flat, I mean 300 second cooldown. And there are there are items in the game which you can buy with gold that you get from killing Minions or from killing your opponents. And those items can make you more powerful and help you win the game. And there are two types of attacks called eh P which stands for ability power and the other one called. Attack damage, I believe, yeah, it's attack damage. Which those two are very important to know 'cause once 'cause each champ scales with it differently.",3.0

You sit when you work, you sit when you commute while sitting. So how do we increase your step count? You can set an alarm on your phone. To go off every hour and when the alarm goes off, you get up and you take a couple steps.

"OK, so this is going to be the basics of how to drive a motorcycle. Um, disclaimer, I'm a beginner. I don't know we're doing so this is just. The very, very basics. So I drove my recycle. There's four parts of a motorcycle. Your right hand controls the throttle and front brake, your left hand controls the clutch, your right foot controls the rear brake in, your left foot controls the gear shift. So if you've ever driven a manual car, it's the exact same principle is that it's a manual transmission. So what you want to do is you want to pull in your clutch to start and you turn on your engine and then you use your. Left leg and you shift down into first. So your bike should start at neutral and you go down into first year and then you want to release the clutch and slowly roll on the throttle at the same time when you release the clutch your back is going to start to slowly pull and the more throttle you give it. The more RPMS they're going, it doesn't necessarily mean that you're going faster and just however fast you release the clutch is how fast you're going to go. So if you dump the clutch, you're going to jerk. So if you're in first gear and your role in Nice and smooth, you pull in the clutch and you shift. So you take your foot. This is the peg you shift down into first and then you take your foot and you shift into second and then neutrals in the middle. Sleep on the couch, you shift up into second year on the throttle and you slowly release. Most bikes have. I would say most bikes have five gears, some have six um and you just you roll all the way through the gears until you're wearing need to be in your cruising down shifting. So let's say you're rolling in 6th gear and you're approaching a stop light, ah, you're going during pulling your clutch roll off the throttle, shift down and you're going to slightly let out the clutch and then down into. All the way down first when the clutch brake stop in there you go. Well done.",3.0
"Hi my name is Charisse and this is how I became an external. So I've been part of the program for a long time. I joined my freshman year at Skyline High School being part of Falcon Tech. Um. I did four years of schooling that graduated in four years, and then I had a summer internship with IBM, so was my very first IBM paid position. That was really great afterwards. The idea was to either join an apprenticeship or a Co-op um. Both of those fell through. So I ended up taking a gap year and just working, doing random jobs, um, just doing I think it really could to make money. And then about halfway through the year, sometime in March, some cops became available. And if you don't know, a Co-op is part time school and part time work. So I enrolled in school. In order to be able to work for IBM and I got a job, so that was really exciting. I was finally working for IBM. Um, I did my Co-op. There's a lot of fun. Um, I got an extension through the summer and then I was actually off boarded on a technicality. So I spent a month not working for IBM anymore as they tried to. They work to re on board mate. I got re onboarded full time through the summer. I did that, and then through the Co-op I heard about the bridge program and I applied to the bridge program mainly because. The bridge program has the goal in mind to get you a full time position at IBM afterwards, either an apprenticeship or for a full time role, which has been my goal. Um. So I applied to the bridge program, I got in and now I'm a next time. So I get to work with some really great people here in the Boulder campus and um, Amanda and Julie, just great. So yeah.",3.0
"Have you ever stopped to think how many steps a day you take? You may live in the city. You may go to the grocery store, go to the gas station.

So imagine how many steps that you take a day. Many of these. This information gets overlooked, especially if you don't have a tracker or smartwatch in order to count your steps. Um, people, you may not realize how many steps you actually take a day. So on average, a person takes 7500 steps each and every day, and that sounds like a lot of steps.

You turning 4 at the time. Also, I was not ready or prepared to relocate at that moment either. So I've just always updated my resume, always stayed connected with those who I've had the opportunity of working with over the past several years at IBM, whether it's through LinkedIn or e-mail, just checking in and constantly applying to different career positions on the IBM careers site, so.

"OK, so let me teach you how to play my favorite grain. It's called spit. Spit is um Accardi game, so very similar to solitaire. You can play this um normally, traditionally actually supposed to be about two players, but sometimes when they have family gatherings and everybody wants to get in on the fun, we have about three or four of us that play together. But essentially um spit, their principles of spit comes from solitaire. So you are trying to place the cards in a manner. Where it either ascends or descends in chronological order. For example if you have a eh's you can put down a king or a queen then uh, Jacqueline attend. But when you put on that 10 you can also put the Jack or A9 on it so it can go either way, can ascend or decend. So how you play spit, you lay out five cards. After you shuffle the deck of course you layout your five cards and um, just make sure that the five cars that they aren't any duplicates. So for example you can't have two. Two, the two threes Electra, 5 cards and you dish out I believe 7 cards to each player. And what you do is you don't look at the cars, you put it face down and you turn them over and when you turn them over you can place them all the five cards that are there. The goal of the game is to of course finish all the cards in your hand or your deck and slap or spit as they called it, but slap on the card that has the lowest step. So after you've played it, you've placed the for example, uh. Nine on a 10 and that's your last card. You have to look and pay attention during the game to see which pile out of the five cards that would sit down originally, which power has the least amount of cards. So once you finish your hand and you see that the pool has a lease amount of cards, make sure that you're able to slap the deck that has the least amount of cards and get it the the goal of the game is for you to get out um with the least amount of cards are to get out to have no cards in the end.",4.0

To your me or like your profile basically and then you click on the plus button and then this is great playlist. So you create a playlist player. After that, um. You can start adding all the songs that you want on the throne places. For me what I like to do is. To Add all the songs, songs by the artist. So like this, eh? Bruno Mars playlist playlist Bruno Mars songs and pretty much and that's what I do. Or you can also put a random songs that that you want to be in the playlist let's say.

Um, just having that general date, you know, when everything is supposed to be done and you have the time to do it on your own time. That really helps me especially 'cause some days I'm feeling more productive than others, so some days I might feel really like it might be hard to focus and it might be really difficult to get tasks done. And other days though it's really easy and all breeze through the five and I'll be back on track in or ahead of the due date. So just having that self-paced is very nice. Um, I don't know.

We had done a lot of projects in STEM and stem related areas. We had built things you know and we I had a lot of fun with them. So when she came to us and said that. In the P tech program, you could also, on top of learning about technology, could earn an associates degree right out of high school. I jumped on the opportunity and I applied. And since then, you know, it's been it's been hectic, but fun. Uh, with all of our programming classes? And going to mentor events and learning a lot more about IBM itself. Being in the building of course was also very fun experience and just talking to a lot of our mentors. Uh, really? Just gave me a lot of insight. And my junior year summer is when I first got a internship. I had a lot of fun there in a lot of great people and so when we got the opportunity about the bridge program, I decided to jump on it as well.

"So not really a product or service, but I guess it could be a service. Um, I recently I'm I really enjoy driving my car. So recently I installed an intake. So I'm going to try to explain that first. First step of the process is of course disconnecting the battery, in my case my old intake. Was. Fed under the battery so I had to just remove it outright. Um, every car is different, but usually just general first rule of anything. Just just connect your battery um and then you know, just under. Unscrew, so you usually need a 10 millimeter. It's pretty standard for most cars, 10 millimeter socket wrench and a Flathead screwdriver for the plastic clips that hold in some of the body panels. Um, after you've on? Bolted the old intake, you should be able to remove it. In my case it was very difficult because again it fed under the battery so there was a lot of hectic things that I had to do, such as just taking off the bumper and then removing it 'cause it was installed on the side, it was a whole process. A lot of cars aren't like that, just had to be mine with a slightly bigger engine than most cars. So there was a lot less room to work with. Um. After that there was some aftermarket parts that also had to be installed. There was an old tube that connected from the old intake pipe and it also connected to the coolant line. And so in my case the part the intake that I ordered came with hardware. You replaced. It topped off on coolant and after that the installation was fairly simple since it was a lot smaller than the old one. And yeah, that's basically it.

And then there's a little restaurant cafe thing, so you don't have to pack anything really if you don't want to. We did. We brought tents and stuff. It's really fun. Um, again, hiking it's beautiful. Um, at night it can get really cold if you're camping, so just bring extra blankets. But yeah, it's great at night. Also, there's no light pollution. You can see literally all the stars.

Uh, what I'd like to do is I like to. Pull out engine from cars. I like to do that. I do that with my truck. When they need to fix it. And that's pretty fun. To do that, you have to start by disconnecting the drive through the drivetrain. And then you disconnect the drive shaft to take it out and then you have to disconnect the. The transmission from the crossmember unbolted. Then you have to like undo the exhaust system, you have to unbolt and take it out, and then you have to. Yeah. And after that you disconnect the, you take the. Mother months off book. By that time you need a Jack to hold the motor up and then. Some in some cars that have to take, uh the whole front end apart just to pull out the engine. And most of the cars you have to do that just to get enough space. So you take the front end apart, then you can get the check to. Is it go big Jack and then just lift it up? And then pull it out and they should all come up when you have to do the undo, like the wiring harness and all of that too. And. Yeah. After you done with that, I'm pretty sure you just get all the radio and stuff like that and after that you're ready to pull it out. And yeah, I guess that's how you feel then, Gina? And. To put it back in, it's kind of the same way you just. Put it in person, both the transmission to the crossmember, then the motor mounts and the. Look.

They offer a program by the name of Peter which you basically get your associates degree. Within four years of high school.

We had these days called Mentor Days, which we went to IBM, the facility I am right now, and we basically talked to mentors on how they do their jobs, what they had to do and all that good stuff.

Personally for me in the morning I'd like to make myself egg because I'd be hitting the gym 5 * 5 days a week and you gotta get that good protein in if you want to see results.

And if you do have other, just cut a little piece. Make sure it's just all around the. And then once you're done with that, you grab an extra bowl on the side. You grab three or two eggs and then just crack them open and dump them into the bowl. And once you crack them all open, you grab a spoon or whatever you can to mix it. And once it's fully mixed like all yellow is, and have a panda butter salsa, Celine and ready to go just um Diego until the band. And if you want you get freshly cut tomatoes, onions, spinach all that good stuff. You can make anomaly if you want to add chicken, all that. But personally for me, I just make my scrambled egg. And then once you put it in the pan, it's going to start sizzling and it's gonna start developing a shape, become hard and then you gather making scrambled or round. Personally for me, I like them scrambled because I'd like to eat it with other stuff and then once you're done. Leaving the eggs um, sizzling for, a sack for. 5 minutes years it should be done with. You can either put pepper or salt and once you put salt and pepper you could just take out the pan, put in a little plate because it have yoga on the side of banana or something like that.

"So I'm going to talk about one of my favorite products at the moment, which is the pocket hole jig. It's a metal device that you use for woodwork where if you want to join two pieces of wood right angles like this. Traditionally you would have used mortise and Tenon joints, cut them by hand, but if you're lazy and you want to do it and make a nice strong joint using screws, this is one way you can do it. It allows you to put screws in you can't see on the back of the word and get them accurately lined up and hidden out the way basically you. Put the woods one of the pieces worked vertically in this device and you clamp it up and there are some holes in the top that you can drill through. You have to slide a piece up to set on a scale the width of the wood that you're using, and it puts it in just the right place to get those holes in. So they just come right through and just out to the edge of the wood. And then you just clamp those two pieces together using a special clamp that holds EMM really firmly in place while you then drill in those screws and hopefully you end up with a nice strong joint that you don't really see. And it's gonna last for years. So it's something I discovered recently and I use it quite a lot now in in a lot of the woodwork that I do around around the house. And I've got to keep speaking.

And basically hold everything together. Now what about the invention around that? Well, there's a lot of exciting developments to come, particularly around battery technology. Renewables and getting the best use active the resources that we have on the aircraft. There's a lot of investment, particularly in direct current systems. We use a lot of AC today. We're going to be using a lot more high voltage DC in the future and there's a huge amount of effort going on inside the company to develop that. And also renewables. Coming back to the big engines piece again, that's where a lot of the investments going now using different fuels. Sochi aerospace. We do an awful lot of mention.",
"I'm Mark Stevens and I'm an engineering project manager at GE Aviation. I deal with the customer. Day-to-day, that's Boeing, and I lead a fairly large team of engineers. And have to do a lot of different things all at once and solve lots of problems every day. And help the team to make progress in delivering the system that we're putting together. How did I end up here? I honestly think it's a couple of things. One is. I just don't know how to say no. All through my career, I don't think I've ever said no to anything, and that's led to me having a world of experiences and going from one job to another, taking on additional responsibility in a number of organizations. First with British Aerospace and an aircraft manufacturer. And after that with the UK Ministry of Defence, where I had. Enormous opportunities to travel the world, work with NATO. To work on flight simulators and with tactical communication systems in support of the war that was going on at the time out in Afghanistan. I think the other thing is I can do a lot of different things at once. It just seems to be something that I'm naturally talented at and I actually enjoy a lot, being able to have to do a lot of different things at once. Some people find that really stressful. For me. It's something really gets me out of bed in the morning knowing that no two days are the same and that. There's always going to be something interesting that I have to deal with. So there we are. That's how I ended up in my current role in G aviation.",6.0
"I live in a house with my family. There are about four of us here at last count and every Friday I put out a. Big box, sometimes 2 boxes full of plastic and a few cans. And I think to myself, where does all this come from? Most of it seems to be milk bottles, some of its yoga. I think I remember as a child. My dad never used to do this. I didn't see him putting out big boxes of plastic I didn't see. Lots of plastic in our waste bin. There is not so much recycling then, but still I don't remember seeing all that. Why do we need all this plastic? It amazes me. There are so many things that we buy that supermarkets think need to cover in plastic to keep them fresh. Surely there's a. Another way of going about this, I think this is something. The world needs to pay more attention to. But how to deal with that? Is it, is it the supermarkets or is it government? Or is it all of us? I feel like. We need to take the charge here and and make. The message strong to the people who? Can take that feedback and make the change that we we all need to get rid of this stuff. I assume that what I'm putting out gets turned into something useful again. I have no way of knowing it could end up just being burnt, which would be. Horrendous situation, but I think we all have to do a little something every day. To try and make that change and maybe the world will wake up and see. How stupid were being here.",7.0

"Hello, today we want to speak about the collaborative idea management. Before we do this, I want to tell you who is here before you, as my name is Natasha. I've been working about six years for the idea management at Siemens. And why it is urgent to use ideas to use the idea management? Because we know about um, some studies. That is more effect that companies could be more efficient if they used the idea management as a method to gain ideas. Not, not, not spontaneous, because collecting in a way. It could, um, use their methods of the idea management could be very helpful. So please tell me what are you your experiences with idea management? Have you heard about it before? Please give me a thumbs up for yeah did great experiences with it and heard a lot or down. No, never had experiences or or heard nothing about it and some between. Yeah, OK, I know about it but I haven't used it or I always order or I get in contact once it's about here. Thank you. OK, thank you for your feedback. Now I want to tell you why it is so efficient to work with a collaborative EMM idea management we could gain. Ideas. Together it's more efficient than only to throw it over and um, maybe someone can use it, or someone don't use it and you don't get feedback quickly. Or you can, um. Ah, it's not that efficient. It could be when you work collaborative for in our time, I think. So then what can we use? Uh, you can use the campaign. Maybe you have heard about that? What would you think could this be? Thank you. Yeah, this is the right explanation for the method we we gained ideas together, we evaluate them and we give feedback just in time from people who need their ideas. Thank you. Oh. So I speak a little bit longer than you know much more about um. Working together so. Let me see what what topics we have here. What are the the biggest topics in your company? Please give me one or two examples you are now working on. Yeah, sustainability is 1. Big. Point we we should speak about it. So how could we elaborate some questions? Who we can put for the workers? Uh, the black, white and blue colors we can address? So let's let's make a little bit brainstorm here. What are the questions with the topic sustainability who haven't had a need at the moment?

And the past few weeks we have been practiced in life hikes, techniques and. For this exercise move very interesting indeed. The use of different techniques and different actions and body language. How to present um, ask questions, ask for feedback. Which is being very interesting with shirt from America in my current role. I have been working on a project for the last six months which is the final works under we on Inverness airport station. This is very exciting for me because I actually I come from the area when which is 50 miles away from Inverness airport. Inverness has never had any eh eh station going into the. And part of the station in Venice Airport was about is about a mile from the city or two miles from the city. So therefore it's gonna be exciting and great link for the area. The area is sometimes quite different, deprived up with employment, so there's been a great investment into the area also. They. Station and the line for about 100 miles is going to be closed for. 11 days over this. In order to Commission. Then you. Facility of the station Siemens bomb network, Dell.

"Hello and good day everybody. Are you interesting in platforms? If so, this is me. My name is Alex correct notice and I'm leading a group of. Digitalization and platforms in the supply chain management organization for pooling indirect. And this is what I'm doing. I'm maintaining and developing platforms for indirect material. Today I would like to present you. A topic which is about the transformation from commodity management to platform management. But to no. A little bit about your skill set, I would ask you a general question. So how good is your knowledge in commodity management for indirect material and platforms? Think about a range of 1 to 10 and. Weight yourself how good is your knowledge from one to 10 so I can know how good your knowledge is into this topic. OK. Thank you. So today I will give you an overview of the transformation approach from commodity management to platform. If we coming from the s s status, this is the commodity management which has. The topic at the moment and maintaining a closed marketplace. So what are their characteristics of a closed marketplace? So at the moment, and this is what we are maintaining, we have a bunch of preferred suppliers which we are negotiating. This has a fixed pricing. We are bundling a lot of volumes in there and in general we have with those suppliers at tight relationship. If you're looking outside of these preferred suppliers. These are for sure high barriers to entry, this closed marketplace and here we have really the topic that it makes it difficult for those suppliers to enter our enterprise environment. And as of now, what we are doing, we just negotiate the commodities which are belonging in our area of responsibility. If you now look into the topic. Of the development, we are talking about the platform management, so here and open marketplace. So the difference would be we can add and have any supplier in this marketplace instead having a fixed pricing. We are talking about a dynamic pricing. There's no bundling effect and there's no relationship at all with any kind of negotiation or contract relationship. So the. The barriers to entry is quite low as they are existing no standards. And we have a full assortment available for all the entries to those marketplaces if we are looking to both of that, um. So on the left side there is if starters the commodity management and close marketplace and the future approach of a platform management and open marketplace that transformation could look like that. The golden mean. So a balanced marketplace here, we would have a mixture of both worlds. So a pool of selected suppliers where we drive competition, a dynamic pricing we can bundling on a pool of suppliers, we can create transparency and competitiveness.

"Hello everybody. Today I want to give you an overview about cost and value engineering. And we are lucky because we are not so many people, we are only five people today. So you can ask any question you want to because we have enough time. First of all, I want to tell you what we are going to learn. So you will get an overview about what is cost and value engineering. What are the benefits of constant value engineering? And last but not least, how can you approach us to set up a project together? First question in the room, who has experience with constant value engineering? Thomas OK, what experience do you have? OK, that's great. Uh, some other person? OK, Natasha. OK. Well, so good. So I see there's already experienced in the room. Maybe we can do a little um question to get an overview about it. So what amount of experience do you have? Of course some value engineering. So let's say one is you do not have any experience with it and 10, you could be the master expert of cost and value engineering in the world yourself. So just indicate it quickly, please. OK, I see some sixes, some sevens. OK uhhh evil heart. Maybe you can tell me what you see. OK, that's great. Yep. Thank you. So we see we already have a good experience here in the room. So I do not have to start from scratch. But what is important is that you know how we define cost and value engineering ourselves. Uh, we have the focus on customer because that is the most important. We have to make sure that our products are bought by the customer. So we always have to have this in mind. Second, the entry point for everything that we do is to cost transparency. So the cost in cost and value engineering, we have the cost transparency because this helps us to. Um, make decisions based on facts. We are working a cross functional team with engineering, with procurement and with us and cost and value engineering providing this cost transparency so that we see what is the best next step for us. We also have the Vida value when we help you to improve the value for the customer so that he is willing to pay more money for our products. And last but not least, the E for engineering. What is the technical expertise that our team has so that you do not discuss about in high level productivity approach, we tell about deep diving water cycle times, what uh, setup times, what are um?

"So welcome everyone. Welcome to today's session where I will tell you something about our agile journey in our department. My name is Eva had. I'm gonna be your host today, your moderator, and please also your communication partner. This is not going to be a front presentation without interaction. I ask you to step in as soon as you want. Whenever you have questions, please do not hesitate. Ask them directly, but first it's. On me to ask questions when you hear Agile, what resonates in your head? What comes to your mind? Please type it in the chat. And then we see what's already there when you think about enter. OK, I can see it's a speed. It's low hierarchies. Sprints and scrum. Yeah, that's a lot. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yes, indeed. Agile is about speed. It's about. Implement and acts faster. Increase speed. Decrease cycle times. But not only with Scrum. And Sprint methodologies, but also with a Kanban board. And the difference between the two is you have this scrum, this interactive, interactive, fast cycling. Methodology. When you have smaller. Iterating always small, let's repeating tasks. When you have complex tasks which take longer at which are independent from each other, you could also use a Kanban board in the HR methodology. And this is what we did in our department. Due to the fact that our projects are not very iterative. But they are long lasting, do not depend on each other. And others D coupled and that's why we have Kanban board with different columns for each step. Off the process. The intention though, it's the same. It's to act, revise, and communicate faster. Focusing on the deliverables. Instead of activities. And of course, also to change the way we work to improve the interaction with us in our groups. And of course, also with you as our internal customers. To really integrate in this process, to really work together, to collaborate and to deliver as fast as possible according to your needs. We started about half a year ago. Um. With support from 2 Agile coaches, we set up the typical daily meetings where we meet as a team. We discuss about the obstacles, the impediments. We also discuss about the results, the positive things that happened since the last daily. We quickly and very flexibly support each other. Ask for support, provides support.

"Did not really cool is that on average a person walks around 7500 steps today, um away.

If you're trying to lose weight, you can use your watch that possibly track 10,000 steps rather than 7500.

"Ah, so today, right now, I'm going to teach you how to drive a stick shift car. Um, so the way to drive a stick shift car, the main thing you want to do, or the main thing is you're controlling the speed of the engine and the speed of the transmission, which is the whole point of driving stick. Normal automatic cars do it for you, manual transmission doing yourself, which is what that's part of the fun. Um, you also control obviously the gearing, where you, where you're at, how fast you can go, all that good stuff. So the main thing is when you get in the car. Turn it on. You want to make sure that your stick is in neutral, which means they can just wobble side to side. Turn it on, turn it on, you push the clutch in, which is something you don't do a normal cars, and then you turn the key. After that, with the clip still in, you can move the stick to the left and up, which is first gear and then to take off you slowly release the clutch, you feel where it grabs and then from there you start giving the gas. Obviously it's it sounds easier than it actually is, but that's the hardest part. After that, once you do take off, then you have momentum moving through your gears. It's just a matter of pushing your clutch in, putting it in the year you want to, and letting go, um, where it gets a little diff more. Complicated is when you start downshifting, when you start slowing down, um. So what you wanna do then is you're gonna put, we're gonna push the glitch in go into the gear below. Um gave it a little bit of gas, which is what they call blipping the throttle once he goes up, that's when you let go for clutch and that's what just called the Rev matching, which is the main part of controlling the speed of the engine and the transmission. Um you get into a similar speed. So that way when you let go of the clutch, um, like hard does it. Joel. Or whatever you know. And yeah, that's that's how you drive him back.",3.0

"In Michael Jordan's career, he scored over 33,000 points. That means that roughly he if he played 1072 games, that's 30 points per game that he scored. Also, over his his career, he was in the NBA for 15 seasons, so that's 2200 points per season. To put it into perspective, typically a single soccer game, for example, each team will squirt roughly one to two points on average total. Michael Jordan was scoring. 30 points per game all by himself. So, that being said, he is, he is.

"Something that I think. The world maybe doesn't do a great job of right now, but I think we should pay more attention to is how we treat other people. Um, it might not be an issue that's supported by A cause or something like that, but I think it's direly important that as people, we understand our interaction with other people and how it can affect them. An example is typically driving to work in the morning. Everybody is grumpy. Everybody just wants to get to work so they can start working, so they can go home at the end of the day. And we tend to not be terribly nice to each other, you know? But you're not going to let somebody in when they're trying to merge. You're not going to let EMM exit whenever they need to get off because you're just trying to get to work. You're trying to be there going to be a quick, and you want to get to your job so you can just start your day. Unfortunately, this typically leads to rude things happening, and you never know how what you do to somebody else could really affect them. I I truly believe that whenever you're yelling or flipping somebody off when you're driving to work, you have no idea what's going on in that person's life. You have no idea if they're driving slow because they've had a bad day or they've had a bad night. Maybe the baby kept them up all night. You never know this stuff, and it's really important that you treat people the way that you would want to be treated on your worst day. Would you want somebody to be yelling and flipping you off as you're trying to just get to work? It's really important that we take the time to understand how what we do or say or act towards people, how it could affect them long term. Just because it was a quick, rash, angry moment that you've shared in your day. It could last their whole day. You could have really just pushed them right over the edge into somewhere that they might not be able to get back from. So I think it's incredibly important that we. Think deeper and more about how we treat other people every single day and how it could affect their daily lives and long term lives.",6.0

But since I live in Ohio now, you kind of have to bring them to yourself. So you have to order them when they have to be alive when you order them. So you have to order them directly from Louisiana. I will not buy them from anywhere else. I refuse and it is. Overkill, I know, but I will not buy them. Pretty girls has to be from Louisiana. They ship, um, live overnight, so it's usually on a plane or overnight truck or something like that. And as soon as you get EMM, you have to take him out and you like put him into a kiddie pool with some water and some ice and keep them nice and cool and moving around and alive until you're actually ready to cook them. So to prep though, you get like this huge pot of water and you fill it all the way up. It has to be a pretty big pot of water and you put all of like the spice and the seasoning stuff in there. And then you cut up some tomatoes, corn, mushrooms, anything sausage. You put a lot of sausage for the people that don't actually like crawfish and put it all in there. And you start letting all of that start to boil. And once it's boiling the mushrooms and like the potatoes, everything is nice and soft. That's when you actually add in the crawfish and you just do it a couple of pounds at a time so that you're not eating cold crawfish. You do, you know, maybe £2.00 here. Put him in. You wait 8 minutes, a lot of cook. And then as soon as they're done, you'll take him out and naturally you have to do it and true Louisiana style and you just dump it straight onto a table with some paper towels or newspaper or something like that, but just straight onto the table. And as soon as they're cool enough to touch you teach everybody around how to eat them. And then some people suddenly decide they don't actually want to eat the crawfish ever again. They never want to see him. And then everybody else like me that we eat to er fill and that's that's how you make crawfish from Louisiana person, I guess.",6.0
"My work related topic today that I'm going to talk on is building a long term contract with the supplier um. Not terribly exciting, but very important to the GE Aerospace business is having sustainable and reliable suppliers that we work with, UM, that we have set terms with and that we can help kind of control a little bit as protecting GE as well as giving a supplier what they need to be a sustainable business. So building a long term contracts typically starts with understanding what parts we can put it as supplier, what price they're going to be at. And then from there, we start to build out the contract terms. Contract terms are very important. We work closely with legal in order to build out what works correctly for the supplier. Some things will work great for big businesses that don't work necessarily for small businesses. In order to do that, we look at what kind of terms they have in the past or if we're starting from scratch, we start with our strongest terms for GE. So what protects GE the most, we start there. And then we typically go back and forth with the supplier to negotiate what we. Think would work best for both of us. It's not always at happy or easy negotiation, but it is something that we have to do with our suppliers to make sure that we have a strong contractor on the parts that we're going to be getting it from them over the next length of years that'll be next. So contract links can be anywhere from two years to five years to 10 years. If we really like a supplier, we like their pricing, we like their contract terms. We're going to try and go as long as possible. That gives us the ability to protect GE. And give the suppliers and steady income for a long period of time and they know that we're working together as a partner. In the end, what you're really looking for is a strong contract that gives GE and the supplier Peace of Mind so that we can have solid delivery and a good relationship with them for several years to come.",6.0
"In order to have a steady and reliable supply chain business, we do a lot of what we call Lt EH or long term agreements or long term contracts with our suppliers. So our suppliers excuse me will give us pricing, they will give us the parts that they could do and we throw all of those onto a contract with them and then from there we have to build out the best terms that we can get with them. So anywhere from payment terms, um working on delivery, damages, things like that we. Build that out with them so that we can protect both GE and the supplier G by having some sustainable ways to deliver parts, good contract terms that guarantee that we will get those parts at the price that we've agreed upon and there will be nothing wrong with the parts we get them. And then strong terms for the supplier to be able to support their business and give them the work that they need to keep their doors open and keep their people employed for X amount of years that they are going to have the contract with us, which could be 5 to 10.",

"So how I started um as an extern with IBM um? So. Back during high school, I was part of the P tech program where I got to have a lot of good opportunities with IBM.

Work for the product management team, for the Z systems and. Throughout my time there I had some good experience with some technical documenting and then I also got to spend a lot of time in the. 3D scanning lab. Both of those things were very interesting to me, but I wanted to pursue education and I wanted to make sure that I was able to get a four year degree after I graduated from the P Tech program. So after I got my four year degree, I went on to work for a few other companies and I got to give myself good experience as well. I've given myself a good idea of. What I wanted to do, I learned a lot of things about myself and also about how I wanted to go about my career and my future. Um, I. Was informed about the Externe position um through uh, Amanda and. I felt in my mind that it was going to be a good thing for myself, that it was going to be better than just working for position at another company.

What the future of the books are going to hold? Um, so people were upset with the ending of the show? I think that it's OK though, because I have confidence that the books will.

"OK, so my favorite game would be 2K23. So we're going to start off with the basics. It's easier to play if you know what basketball is, so you can dribble with the joystick. You go left to go left, you go right to go right. For the joystick to run, you want to hit R2 or RT on the Xbox to accelerate. To pass, you can do multiple passes, so if you want to do a straight pass. You would hit X. If you want to do a bounce pass, you would have to. And if you want to do a lot of pass, you hit triangle and able to do a flashy passer, would double tap to uh, lobby would double tap triangle. In order to shoot you with uh, you square an expression on this new 2K. You want to fill it all the way up to the top and anything else and you are missing and so we want to do that. If you want to call for a pick, you could tell one or what is it? Is it L? I will be on the Xbox. If took off work, pick and then you would go left with the pic or right around the pig. So you can do that. To play defense again in a defensive stance, you want to hit R2 to take a charge. Would hit oh. And to block you would hit triangle. And what else can you do? And then basically you can call plays. If you hit the arrow buttons, you can pick different plays of which way you want to do and then the game will tell you which way you want to go for those.

One thing you can do is check out the world, make sure there's no typos and second one is check the time of your presentation. Typically it's 1 minutes per slice. If you have 20 minutes in the meetings public, you have 15 to 20 slides that will be good. Third is most important is that make sure all those automation picture, movie, YouTube link work.

"OK, Eric. So I'll be talking to you about how to make, eh, aquascape. And basically it is Aquascape pond, so where you take a vessel almost 1 meter in diameter. And then you collect all the stones, the sand, the gravels and then some Amazon soil. The Amazon soil is basically used to put the put the plant setup so that all these floating plants and the plants which you mount onto the base of the aquarium, those get the necessary minerals and the material from it. Once you put the Amazon soil you have planted the plants then put in the gravel. So this gives a little more strength to the plants because you have pulled them, pull them out from a different set up and you are trying to grow them here. Once this setup is ready then pour in the water and then add a chlorine dechlorination liquid. Allow the water to settle down for 2/2 hours once the water settles down and the water is free from chlorine. You can introduce the features into it and once you introduce the physicist, slowly add the driftwoods. So this gives a kind of setup for the plants which are solitary so that so that they can hide behind those those driftwood and those plants that you have put in, put in it and keep feeding the fishes every once in every two days. And that is how it will soon start to flourish. So when I had tried I eat took one. Male fish, male guppy and three female guppies. And now if you see at the population it has grown to 300.

"One of my favorite games to play with um groups of friends is called Kings Cup and it includes a deck of cards and let's just say for this um explanation, a cup of water in the middle. So you take the deck of cards and you spread them out in a circle around the cup of water in the middle, and each card that you pick up stands for a different task or something different that you do either with another player or by yourself. If you pick up an ace, um the water or whatever liquid that you have that you were drinking, you waterfall and it basically goes in the circle of people and it does not stop until the person who picked up the card stops. If you pick up a two it means you so you pick a person to drink their water. 3 means me. So if I were playing for instance, I would pick up my water bottle and I would. Drink from the water. 4 means floors, so everyone in the group, once the card is shouted out out loud, everyone would point to the floor and whoever is the last person to point to the floor loses. 5 means guys, meaning all the guys would drink their water. 6 means chicks, meaning all the women would drink their water. All the women playing. 7 means heaven, which is very similar to floor you would point up to the sky and whoever was the last one. To do it would essentially lose. 8 means mate, meaning whenever you had to drink your water, a person of your choosing, um, would also have to drink their water for the rest of the game. 9 means rhyme. So the person who picked up the nine card would say a word and would continue in whatever direction of the circle you want to go in, basically rhyming with the word that they have chosen. 10 means categories. Meaning you would pick a category and basically like crime would go around the circle, Jack means never have I ever. So whoever would be the first person to put all their fingers down in a game of never have I ever would essentially be the loser. Queen means question master. So throughout any point in the game, if the person who picked up that card asks another player a question and they answer, they would automatically lose innocence.

Um, we engage into in deep discussions with our health care professionals to bring back these insights so that we could drive the strategy and find you any further you know years, um in the next few couple of years.

But often when you do something a little bit different in terms of learning the technique, it makes it more memorable.

I believe that this is in this day and age, you know, we've changed a lot. There has been a lot of growth. Um, women are now in the workplace versus. You know, in the past. Women, you know, they stayed at home their their job was to take care of the kids. From morning till night 24/7. Take care of the household and the man went to work. But in this age we are at the point where women are also in the workforce. Women are out there full time working and then coming home to an even harder job, right? And during that first year of of postpartum after having the child, it is the hardest if you're breastfeeding, breastfeeding, you know it's meant to take up to a year, um, if your child is having sleep.

Um, the additional, you know, stressors of life on top of that without understanding where we are here in 2022, I think is, is, is one of the biggest issues and one of the biggest problems that we're at here. And I think paying attention to postpartum mothers, um, even mothers who are currently pregnant, any, you know, problems that they're having, any fears that they're having any doubts, postpartum depression? And justice healthcare in general it's expensive here in the United States why when you go other places women are maternity care is covered 100% children are covered postpartum up to a year is covered where you have that maternity leave.

And part of our job is, you know, making sure that the programs are following up with the DoD regulations and one of those regulations involves UM. Reporting requirements. So whenever there's there's a long list of things when you have a security clearance with the US government that you have to report one of those things being foreign travel and foreign contacts. So anytime that. You leave the country, whether it's like I was speaking before, a long trip to Europe or a short trip to Canada or Mexico for even just a few hours. Even if it's not a full 24 hours, um, you're not staying there long term. Just anytime you hop over the border of the US border, um, you have to report that, um. So basically as soon as you know about your trip, you um, we have a feature on our. On our portal, that's our Industrial Security website and that allows you to go in and report that travel. It asks you a bunch of questions, um, pre travel and post travel. So pre travel you fill that out anytime that you. Um, know about your trip, you've got your tickets booked, everything like that. Post travel, though, there is a requirement that you do need to fill out the form within 5 days of returning to the United States. So we have to keep up with that and make sure that people are properly reporting new regulations just came out about it being actually a security incident. Now if you don't report it. So before it was just kind of us catching up with people, making sure they report it. But now it's like if you don't report it, it's considered a security incident that we then have to report that on top of it.

Each state has their um, what's an airman, airman of the year biggest award that you can get while you're in the United States Air Force? While one of the bigger awards, I won't say the biggest. And. As a member of the United States Air Force, when I want it at the squadron level, that automatically takes you to the state level. So we headed up to state, you know, and they introduce everybody, they go through your profiles, they say who, who the individual is and they talk about you for a bit because you provide them with some details about you. As you provide those details, um, you know, we're sitting at all of our tables. It's like a banquet. And we're talking with people were meeting different higher levels of individuals from airman all the way up to general. And as we are meeting them, I, I hear my name as they're talking about the people I hear my name. And I just kind of froze. I said no way.

"Who doesn't love a pancake? Today I'm going to teach you how to make pancakes. Now pancakes come in at least two styles that I know of. One is the then French crepe like pancakes which is my personal favorite and the other is the thicker American style pancakes. The recipe I'm going to teach you today is for the thin crepe style pancakes. The way I remember this recipe is by the simple phrase one to one. To 1:00 to 1:00 so 1 cup of flour, 1 cup of milk, one egg, and one teaspoon up one pinch of salt. First of all you sift together the dry ingredients. Then you create a well in the centre of those ingredients and Ed in your egg. Then you start to mix these together and slowly add in your milk. The slower you can go the better for this step, because the slower you go, the less likelihood you have of developing lumps and the pancake. Once the better is nice and smooth, then heat up a pan with a small teaspoon of butter. Pour in about half a cup you better, and then cook it until bubbles start to appear on the surface. Flip the pancake over and cook the other side for about 2 minutes. Then continue this way until you've used the remaining mixture. Finally, you can add any topping that you like. My favorite is lemon juice and sugar or Maple syrup. Some people prefer more of a savory flavor, so mushrooms and sour cream go nicely. Others with a very sweet tooth might like to add chocolate and whipped cream and ice cream. However you like your pancakes, I hope you enjoy them and that this recipe works well for you.

"Hi, my name is Elaine. Um, I would like to share with you today about um, how I got into this career and how it has been in terms of a career journey for me. So it's been almost 15 plus years in this industry for me. I started off as a registered pharmacist and I've already had a good opportunity to experience different functions while I'm in the Pharmaceutical industry from starting from sales. To the medical fast rose and also moving into marketing as well as patient advocacy work.

"Hello and good afternoon. My name is Elaine and I'm here to share with you my favorite coaching tool. So right now, I'm extremely excited to be able to use situational leadership, which has been recently trained and introduced to us in Amgen. So let me tell you a little bit about situational leadership. And this is actually a theory that was introduced back in the 1960s, if I'm not wrong, by someone by the name of Ken Blanchard, um as well as Paul harshly, so that they've developed many versions. Of the situational leadership model throughout the years and the most recent one in 1980s states introduced situational leadership too. So it's really about a leadership model rather than a management model. And here we call the person in charge as a leader, not really a manager and a purpose are really using situational leadership is really to match the style of your employee and the needs of your employee for a specific task or situation. So for example, there are four leadership styles where. The leader needs to choose one of it during the coaching calls. So for example it could be in the case of a coaching for empowerment where you may want to say then this person is at eh DI 4 development level 4 and is able to do the task fairly well and hence you do not need to do so much of a supporting role but more of a delegating role. So there are many areas that is really exciting about this and I think the main thing that I really want to share is that the ability of the leader to. Match with the employees development needs. That is really very unique and that is a style of coaching which I think I want to further develop for myself as well as use it with my teams. So hopefully you've learned something from me today about situational leadership and the next time someone talks to you about it, you have an idea what this is all about. So happy learning, happy coaching by.",3.0

Prepare the Dana certain way so that I can address the ER priority concerns first. And if that's not in the way then I go through my emails just to make sure everything is done with scheduled deadlines as I do have two, four operational side of things help to look after some of these deadlines as well and then I go into coaching. So I spent a big part of my day coaching and I have a wonderful conversation with them on various coaching topics. But essentially that's really how I spent the day and it's maybe the the only thing that I could say is. It's always different for every Cauchy and hence is always very interesting.

"If you're one that likes fish, then today I am going to tell you how to cook the best fried fish dish that you could think of. It'll start. By grabbing a large cast iron pan and filling it with canola oil that is 2 inches deep. Put that pan with the canola oil onto the grill. Heat it to 350 degrees. And wait. Roughly 20 minutes for it to come up to temperature. While you're waiting, go back to the kitchen and start to cut up your fish. I like to take long pieces of filets, cut them up into 6 inch increments and then. Start to do a dry brine. The dry brine consists of flour, salt, pepper, and I love to eat. Add some Cajun spice for heat. If you don't like the heat, don't bother putting that portion of it in. Mix it all up in the bowl and then add your 6 inch filet cuts. Make sure you cook both sides. Top, bottom, sides and then put them back onto a plate. Bring them out to the grill where you are heating up your canola oil and then start to place them in the oil. And allow them. To fry 5 minutes on each side or until their perfect golden brown Keller. Once that's complete, take them off, put them on a drying rack, let the excess oil and moisture drip off so they become nice and crispy, and now you are ready to consume your beautifully fried fish.",7.0

This is an incredible thing, especially when you think about how male dominated ain't the ancient world tended to be how Spartans were shown as this militaristic male dominated society, when in reality 40% of the land was owned by women. Is absurd. Um, certainly great, but absolutely absurd. It's shocking 4 out of every 10 and it's mind boggling.",6.0
"Have you heard of the Civil War in Ethiopia and Tigre? I'm guessing you haven't. And why haven't you? Because it's a minor power, there's no nuclear threat, there's no large global catastrophe that could occur, and so it doesn't sell headlines. And I think that it is conflicts like that in Tigre and in Ukraine for that matter, even though that is considered a larger conflict. That people need to pay more attention to. It doesn't sell headlines, but I am a strong believer in the windowpane theory that if you solve the small cracks and you learn from those small cracks and you repair them before they can get larger, then you can stop the windowpane from breaking. And I think seeing these smaller conflicts, whether it be armed or whether it be strong political or whether it be political strife and friction between two groups, whether it be in the same country or in multiple countries, learning from those conflicts and how to handle them peacefully and how to handle them such that everyone comes out may be equally unhappy but together. Those types of things are very important for our growth as a global society. And being able to live and function together because, like it or not, we're stuck on this rock together until we can figure out how to colonize Mars. So I think the world needs to pay far more attention to these smaller. Minor conflicts in order to better learn how to advance humanity and be better people.",7.0
"If you ask me what GE Aerospace does, and you are. You might expect me to put up a picture of an engine and show you the fan, compressor, combustor, turbine, LPT. And say we design all of this hardware, and we make air this hot, and we produce this much thrust. But at the end of the day, that's not what we do. GE Aerospace allows families to connect. It allows. A boyfriend and girlfriend to see each other who are working in different states, who haven't seen each other in months. It allows the warfighter to protect the people at home and it allows us to bring those brave soldiers home when their duties done. GE aerospace. Emm powers flight, it lifts people up and more importantly, it brings them home safely. It allows the world to stay connected. The entire globe weather, from commerce to interpersonal affairs. GE Aerospace helps keep everyone together. And we do it safely as our top priority. So what does GE do? We connect people. And we keep them safe. We lift people up and we bring them home safely.",
"I was a little under chest high when my dad and my mom and I went to Washington, DC and visited my dad's best friend who works at Johns Hopkins applied Physics lab. And there he took me on a tour of the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, where I got to see a ton of rockets and space probes and all kinds of neat little things in rocket science. And it was then that that fire was lit in me to become an aerospace rocket scientist. Here. And so I'm, I did my first Co-op at NASA where I got to work on a small satellite program working on something maybe about yeah, big couple feet, foot and a half by a foot and 1/2 maybe. And then after that I decided that GE is where I wanted to go and power planes. And so I started there in my first Edison rotation working on eh engine that was going to certify, and I was working on the 1st engine that would have a structural duct. A major part of the structure of the engine made of composite, something that never been done in the industry before. It was truly a remarkable experience and it's something that is truly a feather in the cap for GE. And it was a privilege to be part of such a huge advance in technology. And then from there I actually worked backwards in the engine cycle. So I went to a development engine working on the XL100, where I worked on what will become the next generation of engines flying and. For the warfighter, and then I worked even further forward in the engine process where I worked in preliminary design and there, instead of owning only one or two pieces of hardware, which is what typically someone does, I owned the entirety of the engine I worked. I owned everything from front to back and that was truly a remarkable experience.",7.0

And my first Co-op was at NASA, a dream job since I was that high and I got to work on the satellite project that would help determine. The next generation of satellite experiments in the future. And then I joined GE. And while GE my first Edison rotation, I got to work on the industry's first composite major structural duct, which was a huge step forward in the industry. And then I moved further forward in the life cycle of the engine working in military to work on the next generation of engines for the warfighter. And then even further forward my next rotation, I worked in preliminary design where I own the entire T of engines that will be out in the next few years. Incredible.",
"I say quinoa hash. Probably makes you cringe a little. However, you'll find that it is an amazing lunch that you can vary from week to week and not get bored, and you also don't end up with that food coma after lunch. So how do we start? Well, first. I use an instant pot to cook it. I love pressure cookers. They make things incredibly easy. If you have one, I highly suggest using it. So we start out with the instant pot on the counter. We take our quinoa, pull it out there. I use about a cup and 1/2 so I use about 1/4 cup everyday. Rinse it off, get all of the dirt or the shells off of it. Makes it a little bit sweeter, a little less bitter. Throw that in. Add some chicken, chicken broth. 112 ounce can will do it for you. Then on top of that I add in all of the harder vegetables, the stuff that won't crush. Underneath the pressure. So I'll use corn. I'll use black beans, tomatoes, carrots. Onions. Throw that all in there or some mixture of that or anything else you want, maybe some broccoli or anything like that then. You can add your protein, so I will mix it up from week to week and Dewey sausage, kielbasa sausage, chicken, browned ground beef, whatever suits your mood. It's it will go fantastically with whatever you have. Seal that in the instant pot. Put it on for maybe about 3 minutes. Let that start cooking. While that's cooking, then your soft vegetables, your zucchinis, your Peppers. Uh, I like to throw in spicy Peppers quite a bit. So cenzos jalapenos, add a little bit of a kick to your lunchtime and wake you up a little bit. And then, once your instant pot is done, released the pressure out of it. Take your soft veggies, throw those into the overall mixture, and stir it all up. Add in any seasonings you want, maybe a little salt, maybe a little garlic powder, or maybe a little something, something however you like it, and you can mix all of that up from week to week. And then you have six days at the end of all this of a delicious quinoa hash that will not put you to sleep after lunch.",6.0

And the three phases vary from their responsibilities and of course from their activities. The first phase, the strategy phase, is usually. Steered by the strategy department could be the corporate strategy or could be the strategy of the business. So your threaded she departments. It starts with an idea to acquire a company and entity which is of benefit for your business. And as soon as this idea is on the table, the project starts. And um starts also with pre negotiations and also with due diligence is and with that we come into the second phase which is the transection phase. And the transaction phase responsibility lies with the corporate emanated apartment and it's supported by the corporate SCM department, for example our department or sometimes your SCM department. And after the pre negotiations when they're successful you come to up resigning and in the end signing and then the ownership of the new entity. Is transferred from the seller to Siemens. And that's called closing and with the closing. The third phase starts and this is the implementation phase, and the implementation of such an acquisition always lies with the business. So. You have an integration plan. You make in the beginning and then you have different milestones, 180 days, one year and two years milestone usually. And. It's been unusually you have like a performance controlling that is done and whether to check if all the milestones have been fulfilled. And then hopefully the project is successful.

GE is currently developing ardex for the new Boeing Triple 7X or 7779. Which is the next generation Boeing wide bodied aircraft? The majority of the aircraft systems connect to the RDC. This includes everything from the flight control systems through to the toilet flush. This system. Significantly reduces the amount of wiring within the aircraft. Reducing wiring bundles and hence wait. Giving more room. In the aircraft for bigger seats and more storage. And. Um, more economical aircraft? Other added benefits is the accessibility of all this data, enabling predictive software to utilize this data to forecast when things are starting to go wrong. All this is done in a Safeway, enabling G to lift them up and bring them home safely.",7.0

"Alright, so I'm a singer by, you know, as a hobby, I do vocal. I'm a localist. And I do have a lot of folks who come here to my house. To get some vocal training on how can they improve their voice, how can they improve their breath? So some of the techniques that I tell them is number one for breath, right? Like. Most people who come to me er singers or wannabe singers who have a good voice, but they're just looking for some tips on how to improve. One thing I tell them is, you know, first thing you do as part of your exercise on to develop your breathing is take a note. Uh. And hold that note for as long as you can with one deep breath, and then you start measuring it. For example, I would say have a stop stop clock and then take a deep breath. Let go as slowly as you can and keep that note as straight as you can and see for how long you can do that. Now, maybe the first time you're going to get picked 8, maybe 10 seconds, right? And then for the next exercise you go to the next node like you know you have a. Uh, those are the seven nodes, right? So for each of these nodes, you try to take a deep breath and say that that note for as long as you can and see if you can actually match up with the same number of seconds you had for the first node. Now what you will realize, which is basically physics I guess, is you think the amount of air that you need in your lungs is the same for each node. Ah, it's different because the frequency of. Each note is different. So you realize that even though the first node you were able to sing for like maybe 10 seconds, you will find it difficult to manage that 10 seconds for all those different nodes, right? So that's that's a very good technique that lot of people don't realize. You know, you can just sit at home in your chair and do this. Right. And the other thing I tell them is before you go into a concert or into a vocal performance, learn to relax your facial muscles, right? You know this part of your muscle is very underrated because you don't do any exercise for the face. You do everything for your building up, your muscles, on your hands, your legs, your thighs, but you forget that when you sing.",4.0
"Good morning. Today I'm going to talk to you about contracts and services within GE Aviation. What we do in contact with services is. Monitor the immortal. Margin speak it on our contract while the contract was sold to the customer. After we delivered the engines to a customer. So think of it as. You leasing a car? And you have to. Maintain certain rules that you agreed upon when you sign the lease. For example, you would have said you would. Right, the car for 12,000 miles and three-year. Similarly when you sign a contract, which aviation on the usage of oranges. There are parameters that you need to sign up for, which is how much trust you do sign engine or what are the climatic conditions you would fly it on, so on and so forth. So in the CMR or the contract margin review process, we actually check on the parameters that the engine gives us and make sure that the customer is actually abiding by the contract. Now there are penalties if the customer does not. Use those parameters wisely. At the same time, they also get credit if they are not utilizing those parameters as much as we had agreed upon. So this is a very important thing for us to make sure that deviation stays profitable. So that we monitor our margins that we signed on with customers, which are basically long term margins that could last for 10-15 years. So hopefully that gave you an idea of what we do here at the contractor services. Thank you.",4.0

To put it simply, we monitor the profitability of a contracts on a yearly basis to make sure if the projected profitability of a contracts which are usually 10 to 20 years in duration is holding up to what was forecasted at the time of signing the deal. This also helps us to renegotiate the contract. If we feel. The original terms are not holding up anymore. Due to influences from external factors like in COVID. Um, inflation. So on and so forth. Hope this gives you a quick overview of what we do here at the contracts and services organization. Thank you.",
"We at deviation are at the cutting edge of technology. We believe that the current generation of machines have done their part and we do have a responsibility to get up with newer engines that are more fuel efficient that also are not emitting as much carbon that is polluting our environment. So we're deviation are now experimenting with alternate. Methods of fueling our engines, one of them is the sustainable aviation fuel that will bring down emission level where as much as 25%. We are also trying to come up with engines that are hybrid in nature, which means they will take in more of electric power and also. Make use of the aviation fuel that we currently use, but bring down the reliability on those aviation fuel. Hopefully by doing this we at JG Aviation are able to cut down the emissions that are engines emit today and make sure that we have a more greener planet that we can hand over for the next generation that will hopefully do a better job in improving more cleaner solutions that we can all. Live in thank you. It's. So we do have newer engines coming away. Hopefully by 2030 we should have electric powered engines that are flying across our globe.",4.0

Anything that's warm, anything that I can just throw into the crockpot or into the oven. So I'll talk about making my Buffalo chicken dip. It's honestly one of my favorite snacks and it's very easy to make. I always just purchased some type of chopped up. Or rotisserie chicken from local grocery store. A block of cream cheese, Franks, red hot sauce has to be Franks. And Hidden Valley ranch um. Start out with everything inside of a pot on top of the stove. I'll put in the ranch the hot sauce, kind of mix it together, throwing the cream cheese and get it real soft. You're gonna have to stir it a lot just to get that creamy consistency. And then I'll put in the chicken um. Warm that up, stir it a lot, and then the best part that comes in is all of the cheese. So I put in probably 2 cups of cheese to start out, mix it, get it very smooth, and then I take everything and put it into a greased baking dish. Pour that in, make sure your oven is on 350, cover it with cheese and throw it into the oven. Usually about 30 or 40 minutes or so. You wanna make sure that your cheese doesn't get burned, doesn't turn 2 brown? I'll take it out then. And I love having anything salty with it. So no veggies. We aren't making this healthy. We're gonna use tortilla chips or Fritos or something. It's just salty with the crunch. And it's a fan favorite.

I'm asking lots of questions. I'm no longer the expert and I'm no longer the leader of the group, which honestly is refreshing for me. I think the biggest thing is that.

And not only is it an issue the other seasons of the year, but particularly in these months where it gets very cold, rainy, icy. It disturbs me to see so many people who don't have shelter, who don't have a place to go. I think it's something where there's resources and funding that should be available to these citizens of our community. I also think there is an opportunity to take a look at some of the abandoned households that we have or houses that are being torn down. How can we come together and make these homes affordable? And available for those who need help. There's also become a rising costs and just rental prices where you're starting to have people who are honestly hardworking individuals who can't afford their rent. How is that possible to go to work every day to do your duty as a citizen here in our state and not be able to pay your rent? I think we take too much time as a country, sometimes assisting others and other countries, and I understand that part of wanting to help other people move forward, but I was always so did you take care of home 1st?

I will say that it's really met my expectations, part of my transition dealt a lot with. No longer learning, sometimes feeling just a little too comfortable, not allowing myself to be challenged. And I think after so long, in the same arena, I felt like an expert on the subject matter. And I wanted that chance to just be able to learn again, to ask questions, to maybe not be that leader, you know, to to be somebody that that actually wasn't on the leadership team. And wasn't responsible for everything but to have a piece and learn something new, a new subject matter. So it's been a good transition for me. Uh, initially it was a little uncomfortable. I was asking a lot of questions, learning new systems, but over the last few weeks I've actually welcomed that. It feels good to ask questions again.

So you attach your existing bike to the the Turbo trainer device and there's a flywheel so as you pedal it moves a flywheel around. And it measures the amount of power that you're generating and then you can link it up with up with um websites and applications on the computer and then you can monitor your performance such as cycling. So one of the apps that we use quite regularly called swift and that allows people to join in from all over the world and ride together, which is she makes for being more interesting and also they do competitions so you can race each other in a kind of. Virtual environment and by by competing like that you send to improve your performance or that's the idea of trying to improve your performance. But it also has got a sort of fun social aspects so you can message other people on the on the platform and have some like social interactions which is good as well and helps keep up motivation. So it's fairly cheap. So it's about, well it's about £12 a month to register on the website, but once you've purchased all the gear it does make it a lot more. Enjoyable to use, so I can highly recommend so. I think that's really done a lot faster. Ah, I need to speak for 100 seconds, damn it. So yeah, yeah, it's really good.

You can really focus on your key workouts, hitting your power, hitting your cadence, hitting the goals that you're really aiming for. So I'm a big advocate of using zwift wherever possible so you can do fix workouts, you can do races against other people and that really helps with the motivation. So you can, um, mark your performance against other people and against yourself. So overtime you can see your progression and really confirm that your workouts are really having the desired impact. There, the other aspect is, um, the the the way in which the tool measures your performance. You get immediate feedback, so you can see the power and the cadence and everything on the screen exactly as you're doing it. So if you're. And calls for a really hard session. You can see that you're working hard enough and the the tool will give you feedback on that immediately.

Children experience exercise and activities at school with. Feels pain, feels being lost to help building development and just a general reduction in the number of hours in which children exercise. The other issue is too much of the wrong sorts of food, so food with excess sugar and fat. And they both those things possible come down to the lack of education around hate, hate to look after yourself and what the best way of encouraging children to take make better life decisions. And there's also strategic aspects where, um, addressing the cheapness of unhealthy food would be a good idea, offsetting subsidies so making unhealthy foods more expensive to subsidize a healthier food.

"So after another dull week at my dead end job, I was having dinner with my fiance and we were sitting there talking just about how our weeks had gone and I was telling her how much I really hated my job, needed to find something different to do. An out of the blue my tell, my cell phone rang and my old roommate Steve called me up and he said Dave, I have a great opportunity for you. I said. Oh really? What's that? He said well geez hiring and we need more people in our group and. I think you'd really be a great fit. And so I said great you know, and I, I sent him a resume and a few weeks later I had an interview. Now come to find out later, I think Steve got a pretty nice referral bonus for having me come in. But really it worked out great state in that job for almost 10 years and loved it, had a really great experience, learned an awful lot and was able to really leverage that into some other opportunities, so. Since I've been in G, I've had the opportunity to do, I think five or six different roles now, just moving through different levels of experience and a little bit different skill sets and just continuing to work with really great teams of folks and absorbing as much as I possibly can and learn all about the jet engine industry today. That's gotten me to almost a dream job really, where I get to be a direct customer representative on the engineering side with one of the major airframers. And get to talk to them about their new development military products. So it's really exciting get to see things that are on the cutting edge, really tailor things to the way that they want them and help put G in a good light and and get opportunities for us to keep us all gainfully employed for the next several years.

"So the issue I'd like to talk about today is I think our, our society really just has a fundamental issue with treating each other the way we'd like to be treated and having respect for other people's viewpoints. I've been really, quite frankly, disturbed the last few years with all the events that have been going on between COVID. We've had riots around racial mistreatment. We've had, you know, numerous examples that we could use, and again. It's been very, very disconcerting for me. And I think a lot of the problem really stems from we don't try to understand each other. People get on social media, they want to yell at each other. The next thing you know, they're accounts get locked and people are writing. There's just, there doesn't seem to be any, any willingness to come together and try to understand where the other person is coming from, I think. I think when you look at things, people aren't always necessarily as informed as they could be, but at the end of the day it's just. We have these deeply held opinions and they probably all have some some samples of merit to him. But at the end of the day, we're just not really willing to listen to other people care about what their needs are as people and work together to try to find solutions that are beneficial for for everybody involved. And so I think that's really a fundamental issue and I just really hope that that's something that we can continue to work on is just teach our kids and. Each other and take your own advice right? And just really try to put yourself in the other persons shoes and see if we can't work together and come up with solutions to some of the issues that are plaguing us slightly.",6.0

Now, I'm not really a huge NBA fan, so I probably don't have my numbers just exactly lot, right? But 33,000 points? What's that look like? Well, let's just say MJ played 15 seasons, which is probably about right. And let's say that they played 75 games. A year. That would be 2200 points a season, or almost 30 points every single game that he played in. And to me, that's just absolutely amazing.

"Alright, so for my topic, I just want to talk about one of my favorite summertime activities, which is going outside and grilling. And one of my favorite things to grill is simple chicken thighs. I really like them because they are inexpensive, but they're delicious and they almost always come out really well if you do just a few simple things. So to me, one of the most important things about grilling anything is it's all about the seasonings that you use and just making sure your food has a lot of. Um, so really the first step is I like to start by brining them in a solution of like saltwater, some brown sugar, some garlic, some you know, just all sorts of good seasonings. And let him sit most of the day and then take him out before I grill, pattern dry and put a nice rub on EMM and then throw him on a nice hot grill. Get the outside seared and then go to an indirect heat and let him cook for about half an hour. And that really takes it. About the best part. Which is now you're outside, hopefully enjoying a beautiful evening on your deck or your patio. Hopefully you got somebody with you you can crack open a nice beverage and just kind of sit back, relax and let them cook through. Make sure you don't have any flare ups, you know, pretend like you're missed in some water on EM or turning um or whatever once in awhile, but just kind of enjoy the time outdoors. So after about after about half an hour or so then then they should be just about ready to come off. I like to turn the heat back up again and make sure that the skin is nice and just has a little bit of crispiness to it because I think that really adds a lot to it. And then take them off, let him stand for a few minutes, go back indoors and hopefully have a chance to enjoy um with with your family or somebody enjoy spending time with.",6.0

Then an old-fashioned is a great drink for you to have in the evening. It's really simple to make. You only need four ingredients. They'll use simple syrup or sugar cube. If you're old-fashioned, you'll use some bitters, your bourbon and slice of orange. Five ingredients if you want to count ice. You'll start by taking out a clean cocktail glass. You'll put in your simple syrup or sugar cube, maybe about 1/2 an ounce to announce. Depending on how sweet you want it, you'll add some dashes of your bidders. I like to use both orange bitters and regular. Gives it a little extra punch, but that's up to you. Once you've done that, you'll want to give it a good stir and go ahead and measure out your bourbon. One of my favorites is Woodford, but again, up to you to choose your favorite. You'll want to use bat an ounce and 1/2 of bourbon poured in the glass. Give it a nice stir and add your ice cube. If you have EMM, you want to use an extra large ice cube. It'll melt a little slower and keep your drink from watering down. When you're done fat, you want to take a clean slice of orange peel and he like to give it a little squeeze to help get the oils going.

Personally, I enjoy both those pets, but did you know you can tell a lot about a person based on whether they prefer cats or dogs? A person that likes dogs generally likes them because they're so friendly they run up to you right away. They want to greet you with kisses and affection and B pet immediately. Versus cats could be a little bit more difficult. You go up and you try to give him a little pat. They don't want anything to do with you. They may hiss at you, they may run away, they may just hide completely, and you won't even find Emm. Some people don't have the patience for that, which is understandable, but it can tell you how they value relationships. People that like affection immediately without it necessarily being earned through playtime or getting to know the dog, just spending time in the vicinity. They want affection that's easily obtained. They don't want to work that hard for it. Versus cat lovers that are willing to be patient spend the necessary weeks, months. They get to know the pet will bring it treats. They'll try to play games and really earn their affection. Full time to put more work into their personal relationships. They understand that. Trust isn't given immediately, and sometimes you have to put a little bit more work in and it's not going to be instant gratification.

They may hide from you, you may have to put in some time to earn their trust and their love, and depending on whether a person prefers the instant gratification.

"Have you heard of fast fashion? It's killing our planet. Fast fashion is both an economic and sociological phenomenon, and it's grown to epic proportions. Fast fashion is the idea of making clothing quickly. And cheaply. Clothing production has more than doubled in the last couple decades and doubled in the billions. The worst part about it is a lot of these clothes aren't even Warren. 20% of them end up in a landfill, and they're using more resources than ever. A single pair of jeans. Can start in one country for textiles. It can fly across the ocean to then be manufactured into the actual genes. It will fly back across the ocean to another distributor, and perhaps from there it's going off to multiple countries. And 20% are in a landfill and not even worn. The amount of times a garment has been warned has decreased significantly over the years. Fast fashion is increasing the amount of O2CO2 in the atmosphere. It's increasing the amount of pollution wastewater. It's using up a lot of our natural resources. And overall it's just harming the environment and completely unnecessary.

In danger puts in danger and the future of our generation is going to have so much of problems in terms of managing their life. You know what I'm going to talk about? It's about global warming. Global warming occurs when the carbon dioxide and air pollutants, you know, collects in the atmosphere and absorbs the sunlight and solar radiation. And being in the Earth or the surface for a long, long years and guess what? This radiations can eventually escape somewhere. But these pollutants can stay there for years and years and years for centuries and in the atmosphere and that I started creating so much of heat and has caused our planet.

Gasoline and natural cash because we use this intensively for our day-to-day life and that has existed so much of carbon dioxide which causes the atmosphere and creates huge problem to the human being on Earth, not just a human being even to some of her animals, some of the species that's around this globe. So it's very, very important that we understand the global warming to the extent of possible and this has to be a part of everyone's. Curriculum on the schools, on the colleges and the universities make people to understand the impact of global warming.

"So I'm going to be teaching you how to play my favorite board game, which is called Avalon. So and Avalon, you have two different factions of people. You have the bad guys, which are called the minions of Mordred, and you have the good guys who are the Knights of King Arthur. So at the start of the game, everyone is dealt one card, face down. Only you can see it. That determines what faction you're on, using a combination of eyes close, eyes open, take your turn. All of the bad guys get to figure out what team they're on, and all of the good guys have no idea. Once everyone realizes what team they're on, and if they have friends on their team, if they're a bad guy, then the actual game starts. So on the game, you basically go on five different missions, and each mission has a number of people that go on it. So for example, the first mission you need two people to go on that mission. Or by the time that you get up to five people, you, by the time you get to the fifth mission you get like 5 people. So as the game goes on, you slowly have to figure out who you can trust and who you can't trust 'cause when you're only taking two people out of a potential, say 10, you have a very low chance of bringing a bad. But when you have five people you need to bring, you have closer to a 5050 chance of taking a bad guy. It's OK, I still got 30 seconds, just making sure. Um, so everyone votes on who gets to go on a mission. And if the mission passes by majority, those people that go on the mission get these cards. That's a pass or fail. So if you're a good guy, you always have to pass the mission. And if you're a bad guy, you can either choose to pass the mission to blend in, or you can fail it. If there's even one failed, the entire mission fails, and it's first to three out of five missions. So whether that's three passes or three fails, yeah.",3.0

From there they accelerated the throttle all the way up to intermediate power, which is the Max speed of the engine. But that's not all. There's more. It's not even an augmentation yet. From there. The throttle operator inside the quiet. Safe control room. Turn the throttle all the way into mini B and from there my heart started pounding. The floor was shaking.

The seven barges of coal that we're going to be burned that day at this power plant on the Ohio River. I couldn't believe there is me that much carbon released into the air. My name is Dan Hummel and I'm going to briefly talk about nuclear power as a very competitive in. Environmentally friendly source of energy. Now there's this bad impression that nuclear power is extremely dangerous from events like sure, Noble, but if you actually look at the statistics, it's less dangerous than natural gas, coal, and every other energy source. Based on how many people, how many fatalities, think about how dangerous it is just inherently mining coal or natural gas. It's also nuclear powers, also very environmentally friendly. The amount of waste that you have is almost minimal. Compared to how you. Need to spend all the energy to pull the coal from the ground and extract the natural gas and oil. It's much better for the environment to do nuclear power. Think about this as a massive energy source. You'd have to have thousands of windmills and solar panels to place the amount of energy of 1 nuclear plant has. And nuclear plants can last for 40 years or even more if they're properly maintained with the regulations that we have today. Please work with your politicians to help them distribute the message that this is a great way to. To save the environment through generating power efficiently in. Educate people.",8.0
"In 500 BC in Sparta in Greece. 40% of the land was owned by women. I find that amazing and that staggering. How high the percentage was an urban Sparta? Compare this to only 2%. Of the land in Germany owned by women, that's 20 times more. Women owned land percentage in Sparta. I think that that's amazing. And you could compare that to a more drastic difference from zero percent of land in the patriarchal Society of Japan. That's like an infinite more than Japan. Gender equality is an important topic these days and I hope that today urban land can be owned more equally between men and women.",8.0

"You just found out you and your partner are expecting your first child. And you couldn't be more excited? But that excitement is immediately squandered. When you start looking for daycare. You call around to local places. And the answer you get each time, there's no openings a year out, two years out, no options. You come across some that do have openings. But the cost is too high. You can't afford to send your child to these daycares. So what do you do? This is the question and problem that thousands of couples across the US face every year. What to do about affordable health care? Affordable daycare. This shouldn't be an issue. The government should step in and help provide affordable day care to families across the US so that couples don't have to decide whether they are going to work or stay home. In addition, companies should start offering daycare options as well. So you can bring your child to work and they have a facility to watch your children, and that way you don't have to worry about them, you know they're nearby, you can work longer hours. Everybody wins in the end. Sad. This is something that I think needs to be addressed. At a government level. At family level, at a company level to help come up with a solution so that.

And one of the things that you should know is you should be your total, authentic self. That is what the company is looking for. How do you do that? You know, you need to think about where you want to be in two years, five years. Draw, draw the plan. At some point people are going to tell you, you need to go this way. This is the path. You need to do this is the way you need to address. This is the way you need to be seen. You need to speak this way. In all actuality, it's becoming your true authentic self. And somewhere during that journey you find out a lexer that that that special flame that's that's lit and I promise you you'll go back. During that journey and you'll find your authentic self and you'll find what it is that you were set out to do on this course within this company. Everyone we need. Everyone to be some sort of different, but as long as that you find that true meaning of yourself there. True authenticity that you can bring to the table. That the true gestures that you can bring by using your tone, your space right, your body language, the facts you need to edit, think and speak, anything that you're saying when you go to your speak on your topic.

"Hi, everybody. My name is Eric Marquis. I'm here today to talk to you about eh. But now I'm a little record. Just something to think about that Michael Jordan in his. The lust Rias NBA career scored 33,000 points. Right. I think we all know Michael Jordan, right? Greatest basketball player of all time, 33,000 thousand points. Of course, that's where he scored. Well, let's really break that down. What does that mean? Put that in context, 33,000 points, right? How many points you could score at one point on a free throw? Two points? For a regular basket or three-point, Michael Jordan was not a big three-point shooter, right? He went to the foul line quite a bit. So a lot of those were hard one point baskets. Think about that day in and day out. The commitment that he had to have to be able to stay on the court worked that hard. Knowing he's going to double and triple team and still is able to put up 33,000 points. 33,000 points is the equivalent of. Hitting the lottery five times as a regular person, it really is unbelievable. Think of.",5.0
"Hey, everybody. Thanks for sticking with this throughout this presentation. I'm really glad to have an opportunity stand up here and present to you why I think purging is a great company and how it could help you be successful. Let me get into it. Really, I think it's the people. You know, clearing is not an exciting and sexy place to for the industry to be. But I gotta tell you, the people here at purging really are the difference maker. You're going to get people who are committed, passionate and truly care about you and your business. They want the end investor to be successful because that makes you successful, which makes us successful. And you're going to really get that at our firm. I can't really stress that enough. You know, sure you may be able to find a firm that's a little cheaper or maybe they have a system that looks a little better. But in practice once you get under lift up the hood, you see it's the people that really make the difference. So I hope that point comes across to you and we really think about that the next time you're deciding which clearing firm to go with and also want to highlight a few other things that are critical. Pershing has a breadth of products and services available to them that you may. Not even realize we have the banking New York Mellon behind us and they offered the larger the largest custodian in the world and they have a lot of. Interesting. And products that are available to you. So keep that in mind and next time you're thinking of clearing, think. Uh, Pershing. Thank you.",
"Hi, everyone. My name is Eric Marquis. I'm here today to tell you about a topic that I feel really does not get enough attention and its homelessness, right? Living here in the northeast, I'm in New Jersey traveling in and out of New York City all the time. And homelessness really just has become something we've accepted as a society, right? You walk down the street, you see somebody standing on the sidewalk, you step over them, people step around them little kids. Even node said. Oh, that person just they're homeless, they don't have a home, so they live there on the street. Think about that. Think about us as a society. How has that become OK? It really is disheartening when you think about all the things we do for each other when there's a natural disaster. Everyone rallies together, we drive down, we donate food, right? We all come together in a time of crisis. But this homelessness. That exists on a daily basis really is a crisis, but we choose to ignore it. Why? I don't know. I don't think we have a good answer. I think we've just come to accept it and nobody really wants to take ownership of it. We just kind of, you know what, hey, I pull up at a stoplight and there's a homeless man who reaches over, puts a cup, and you give him a dollar, you know, and that's your small way of contributing. Maybe you feel good, but we know deep down everybody feels bad and wish we could do more. So what can we do? Why doesn't the government step in and take action? I think this needs to be a top priority with our local governments as well as at the federal level, right? We know there's money to go around. I think it just needs focus and attention and the people really need to speak and make it a priority. Really hope we could address this major, major crisis that is existing in the United States and we know, quite frankly all over the world. Think about it. Think about how you can make a difference.",5.0
"Hi, good morning. My name is Eric Marquis. I'm here today to teach you how to cook my grandmother's red sauce. My grandmother is from Italy. She moved here in the early 1900s and passed down a recipe to me and my family. I grew up with my grandmother. She was in our house, so I got the smell and eat the sauce and experience it once a week. It really became a family tradition, really a ritual. You know, I would get to help her as a young boy. So my love of eating started with her and she passed on this recipe to me and I'm. Eh, to teach it to you kind of a secret. So don't tell anybody. My family that I'm sharing this. I'll get I'll get really um ousted from the family so. Alright, so it's really a basic, simple and red sauce, we called it gravy. There's a big debate in between Italian Americans whether it's gravy or red sauce, but we called it gravy, but will refer to as red sauce here. So I'll get started. So first, you really need fresh basil. We used to grow it in the backyard, so we had it and then we freeze it for the winter so you always had it available to you. But fresh basil is a key ingredient. You need it. That aroma, you know you could smell it, it stays on your fingers. It really permeates the kitchen, so it's a critical ingredient. We use canned tomatoes. Nothing wrong with canned tomatoes there. There can at the height of ripeness and they really do carry through that that flavor. So two big cans of tomatoes, you pour those into the pot with some garlic and oil, right? First you know you need to marinate the um or saute the garlic so it really smells in permeates the house as well. You pour in the tomatoes, you stir it around, you add a little salt pepper. And your fresh basil, and that's it. You turn it down to a simmer, you cover it, and you let it cook for two to three hours, stirring it occasionally, and then you leave it on the stove all the Sunday to let the house smell fill up the room and you enjoy it over some fresh pasta that evening. And there you have it. You have my grandmother's secret recipe. Now enjoy.",5.0
"Hey, good morning. My name is Eric Marquis. Great to be here. I'm looking forward to presenting to you today and overview of the client transition process. So there are three key elements to the conversion process, one new business, I'm bored into the platform. Two, offboarding, we're not really happy about that, but we do support it. And three, any sort of internal movement. So as you'd expect, there's a lot of industry consolidation going on and we do support firms merging with within the platform. Great for us as we keep assets on the platform, but it is a lot of work and it is a required for our dedicated team to help it so. I'll get started. For new clients that come on board, we have a robust project plan to walk you through from start to finish. We break it down into three key phases. The first phase, the implementation part, we want to really understand how you do your Business Today and how you'll do it later on the platform. This includes enhanced due diligence, really getting under the hood, lifting up that hood and want to see what people do day today. It really is critical and really makes a big difference to. The design and testing phase right now that we figured out what's going on and how we're going to do it, we're going to get in your office and really start testing. We're going to give you access to the system, we're going to code it, and you're going to be able to go in and really see how it looks and feels once you go live. So there aren't any surprises. Sure, there might be a couple, but will be there to help you get through those and three. The live production phase, right. And this really is where the rubber hits the road, right, where all the this is where everything really happens, right. So we're going to get in your office again now. We're going to give you the detailed training. We're going to talk you through everything and we're going to go live. We're going to be there to hold your hand throughout the entire process to ensure you have a successful transition. Thank you.",5.0
"Good morning. My name is Eric Marquis. I'm here today to teach you about the client onboarding process. That person really excited to share this information with you. I've been part of the team for over 25 years and I'm passionate about the onboarding process and how we could help your firm be successful. So let me just jump right into it. The key to on boarding is really 3 phases, 1, the due diligence and exploration phase. This is really where we get to know your firm lift up the hood. And really see what's going on at your firm. The second is the testing and development stage. This is where we apply everything that we learned in phase one and really now put it to practice. This is the coding, the development, the testing. We get you access to the system so you can get in there and really understand how the platform works. And 3rd implementation. This is where we go live or on site. All that hard work we've done up until this point is implemented and you're off to the races on the platform. For a successful experience, thank you.",
"Good afternoon. Question for you. Who wants to own? A robotic Hoover. OK, by show of hands, let's see your answers. Excellent. Jane, Tony, X and a few of you, OK. Who wants to have a coffee? With the head of procurement and Siemens. Hands up. OK, not so many hands this time, but hey both. I'm going to tell you on how to achieve today. So my name is Colin and I'm going to talk to you about the digital mind training course today. So what is digital mind about? It's about. Embracing digitalization. Spending a day or so in a workshop with fellow colleagues to learn about Vuca. If you don't know what it is, you'll find out to learn about your own mindset and your own behaviors and natural instincts. What number 2 um. It's about challenges. So you complete challenges online at your own pace. 30 minutes long, an hour long, a day longer all leads to your learning hours, but it helps your self development. Annual leave as part of a team. Now who's heard of the EH team? OK, Tony, have you? Yep, I have OK, can anyone name a character? Quiz question? Anyone name a character the EH team? BA baracus, correct. Correct. Excellent. So you will leave with your own little eh team. OK, so you do these challenges at your own pace, but you have a network of support so you'll form this. Eh Team is part of the workshop and will complete these challenges. The third thing you'll leave with is the opportunity to win coins and prizes. So as mentioned before, robotic Hoover's meals out for the team, free drinks, whatever you want to choose as hundreds of prizes on there. Just by BIC completing the challenges you will win prizes, so. I know we're all busy bees these days. This is my friend busy, but I can guarantee you. This day and 1/2 on subsequent challenges in team will be the best investment of your time you've made this year. OK. You will really, really get strong value out of it and you'll feel better afterward. The feedback has been terrific, the engagements terrific. Check it out for yourselves.

"Hello. Welcome. It's lovely to see you all here today. Thank you so much for your time. I'm really looking forward to today's session. We've got lots of fun things planned. But first of all, I'd like to give everyone an opportunity to just kind of rate how they're feeling. Maybe if you could put your hands up, say give me, um, how many, how you're feeling today was it's at 2, is that one maybe we've got some people that are feeling 10 super energized and really looking forward to it. So yeah, if I could just get everyone to do that, yeah, you in the back as well, that would be great. Um, and we'll get on with the session. I'm on a call. So today I want to talk to you about the importance of um, a new system that I have created. Um, this will help the interchange between people. Um. And it means that we can kind of make sure that we're finding the costs effectively and also mapping those to their cost centers that we need to map them too. And this will kind of smooth out some of the issues that we previously had, which is obviously quite difficult. Um, I've spoken to a lot of different stakeholders and. Quite a lot of them have been in agreement that we need to do something about this. So this is what we're going to do and this is how we're gonna do it. Um. So firstly, the first thing that we're going to do is to make sure I've got a complete list of all the relevant stake holders and their timings that they are going to use. Secondly, I need to make sure that I've got contact, um e-mail addresses for everybody involved and I hope you're all happy for me to share those around with the rest of the team. Um. And thirdly, I need to make sure that we've got. Everything else is equal to use. So does anybody have any questions in the mean time? OK. That's fantastic. Thank you very much. So next thing we're going to be doing is sharing that around. So hopefully that's OK with everybody. Appreciate that everyone is quite tight for time in this deadline has not come at a great time for everybody, so I'm really sorry about that. But I hope you can work with us to make sure that we can still hit that deadline, um, and we can make something to go forward and that would be really fantastic. Uh, just a quick moment to. Has everyone got 5 minutes, 5 minutes now or is does anybody need to take a little break before we come back and then we can start again? Um. I'm looking forward to getting a um outcome out of this project. I think it's been highly beneficial so far. I'm really looking forward to it. Thank you very much for your time and I'm really looking forward to working with you and hopefully will see will soon.",4.0
"Good afternoon and welcome. My name is Paul Duncan and today I'm going to talk about something I'm really passionate about and that is the green plant catalog. So before I jump in and show you all about this fantastic tool, I've got a question for you. And that question is how much CO2 in tongues do you think that Siemens project site produce over a year? So I'm going to give you a couple seconds to think about that. And just put your answers in the chat. You don't have to take too much time, you know. Two, we thought about it, put the answers in chat, so we got some questions, got some coming in here. It's great. It's good. So John thinks it's 500 tons. 3,000,000 from Jeff. It's quite alot, Jeff. Fewer answers coming in. That's great. It's interesting. So we've got a good range here. We've got a good range. So we've got anything between 100 tons to 3,000,000 tons. The answer to the question is that Siemens roughly over a year and myths about 500,000 tons of carbon. Now you're probably thinking that sounds a lot, but I don't really know what 500 tons of carbon is. Well, it's about the amount of carbon that Skegness produces in a year, so it's quite a lot of cold when we're shooting out there into the atmosphere. And the green plant catalog is all about how we can look at hiring tools that reduce our carbon footprint on site and reduce that CO2 level. So let me take you through and show you this fantastic tool. So here you go. This is the tool here. And if you just click on products, come down here. You can see this various different things that you can order on site, between lights, between vans, between power options. So the idea is if you're sitting there you're a buyer or a project manager, I need something. It's got your options down here so potentially looking with some power and click on power and the options here you can see there's. Battery options, the solar options, there's hydrogen auctions. Does HBO as a bio fuels and option all these things are going to help you reduce carbon. So let's click on here. Biofuel, this takes you through. It gives you the specification, it tells you how much CO2 you're going to reduce by, and it also gives us why you can buy it from. Fantastic stuff. So this is great how you say it's going to save us carbon, but the big question is. From buyers from project managers of conscious about the budget is how much is it gonna cost me. Well this next time will solve this problem. You click on this next tab here it gives you an estimate around OK HBO is this going to save me money? Outside it's going to cost me money. And if it's going to save you money what roughly is going to save me or what roughly is going to cost? From the last tab is key because this piece you or the supplier details. This gives you all the details of who we need to buy it from. So the first tab tells you the CO2, the second tab gives you the price, the third tab suppliers and that the nutshell is the green plant catalog. Hopefully it's something really useful. You can use it to reduce your costs and reduce your carbon footprint. Thank you very much.",7.0
"Good afternoon, everybody and welcome back to the afternoon part of this session, which I'm going to start up with by a quick poll. So I'd like you to show me your fingers to demonstrate how many flights you have taken this year. Now that can either be personal or it can be for business, but I just need to show show up hands how many flights you've taken and if I could ask maybe Colin, if you could take a little average for me. Just look around the room and see how many flights we've on average take them. Yep, that's all. If you want over there, that's really good. 8 You've actually been on eight. Wow. Gosh. So, um, we. Did Colin, could you just give me that average please? Right. So we think it's about a four then around this group. So if we have a thing about the impact of all these flights. On the environment. I would like to share with you some facts and figures that perhaps you're not aware of that might make you think twice about next time you decide to hop on a plane. My name is Emma Eaton and I'm a travel manager. This is something that I am really trying to bring into our company to change the mindset to really make people take ownership over their decisions about their travel plans. Hopefully I will also give you the same knowledge to make those decisions after today. First of all then if you could guess. How many trees you think it takes to absorb? The carbon generated by a transatlantic flight, so from UK to the US, how many just average trees? No specific types, just your average tree in a year. How many do we think? So some guesses please. So Kate, would you like to get? You think it could be 50, right? 50 trees? Um, Brad? 20. Find anywhere in between, higher, lower. Phil. 25. Not quite there, right. So overall then. It actually takes. 40 trees. Or 0 trees to absorb the carbon generated by just one single economy class flight from the UK to the US. We're not talking business class with all your fancy facilities were not talking fares. Class with your silver service way just talking or average flight. If you want to make a picture in your mind as to what that looks like. So that ton of CO2 that's generated approximately. It would take 40 trees. It would be the combined weight of a giant panda. A grizzly bear. A gorilla. And a lion. That's quite a lot of animals. If you picture those stood in front of you, that's quite a lot. So it will take quite a lot more than just a few trees being planted to sort out the amount of carbon. Now that you can picture that in your mind, I really hope that you can use that knowledge to impact your next decision that you make on your choice of flights, your tracer travel mode, whether you even need to take that trip. So hopefully that's planted a little seed for you to grow and to really think about. If they are facts that you've learned today, then please put your thumbs up if you've appreciated those facts or if you knew them already. You can give me some things down. Please let me know what you think. Great. It seems like most people have learned from today, so thank you very much. I appreciate your time. Goodbye.",7.0
"Good afternoon. It's great to see you all here today and thank you firstly for your time. Before I go to my presentation, I wanted to take the opportunity to share a little about me. I'm all about. Digitalization. It's something that I'm passionate about. Um, about leveraging and optimizing technology to support business performance. And in my current role, I do that to support the scene and global temporary worker program and population, which plays a critical role in Siemens business delivery performance and profitability. But before I go into my presentation, I wanted to start with a bit of a body poem. If you think about the seams, total workforce. Think about what proportion of the total workforce you think is comprised of third party workers, temporary workers with this being 1% and to hear being 100%, just take a second now and just give me an indication. OK. So looking around the room and say we've got, OK, so around about 10%. It's actually 25%. 25% of the total workforce comprised of third party workers. In short, it's important. So let me come to my. My first slide, then hopefully you can see. So what is it that I would like to impress upon you that I'd like you to take away? Firstly, I just referenced that third party workers represent 25% of the Siemens total workforce. That equates to the global population of 20,000 third party workers. And spend of circa €900 million, which is the equivalent to the revenue of Siemens India. Again, it's important and it plays a key part in semen success. The second message that I'd like you to take away from this slide is that 80% of the demand is supported by technology by an automated end to end workflow which is C, which is SA P Fieldglass. This supports route to market flexibility, full transparency and a solid base to leverage the ever changing market conditions in this area. Before I move on now to tell you about how I see the market changing and how we are already responding through leveraging the digitalization program. I want to take the opportunity to get a little bit more feedback from you, so I'm gonna do a quick round the room. And I start with you, Evan, and I'll ask you in a moment just to name two things. When you think of temporary labor that are important to you and then I'll make my way around a number of the other participants within the within the group. So Evan, just two words. OK. Quality and speed. It's very reverent about Tom. Compliance shortage. OK. : Quality and cost. Well, thank you all for that input, 'cause I wanted to take the opportunity to get a sense of what's important. Now I'd like to move on to what's changing in the market, the key trends. And how Siemens is looking to to respond and within that I'll ensure that we also include or reference the topics that you just referenced that are important such as cost, speed, compliance, shortage in availability.",7.0

We use non renewable in ienumerable energy, for example petroleum, but we it was best for petroleum for all of our business. But I think that unimportant except we are to invest a lot of money. Is that renewable energy? Because if we use renewable renewable energy probably we are able to live a lot of here more than what we can do with petroleum. Obvious. I think that the new right now about energy are very, very important because we have to be independent for all the fossil energy, and to do this we have to think how to invest in this part. We can invest in the sun and the wind. This is, this is the main important renewable energy that we have and we have to conclude and work, work, work, work and not.

"So I come from a family where gift giving is a big deal. It's a way that we express how we care for each other. And it's just kind of our family culture. But as the families grown, it's become increasingly more challenging to figure out what a good gift should be. Somebody's birthday or during the holidays you're going to buy gift for several people. So it's always been this challenge and then what's more, it's also become kind of a competition. Who gets the guest gifts? Who's the best gift giver, that sort of thing. So it's it's it's all very good and we're very fortunate and blessed and where the circumstance or we can. Do something like this. So. But the challenge was how to find the best gifts.

It's a way for people to create a list of things that they may need or that they're interested in. They maintain their list. It's very easy to do. You can have even links to different. Resources or places where you might find these gifts. And so you can always be assured of getting a gift that somebody is going to appreciate her that they needed. And it's simple. You go online, you create a group, people are invited to join the group. It's very simple, very quick, has worked quite well. So. This gift or online service was uh, was a solution to what was a fun but always challenging problem. OK. Very good, very good. I I loved how you created this situation. Um. He created the situation that I could relate to because I hate buying gifts, but it feels like it's always a fail. And I was, I was, I had an emotional connection and I was brought in and then he talked about the resolution. With the using the app. And describing how the app works. So yeah, I really thought you did a great job. Appreciate that. Thanks. Kind of a tough topic. But anyway, yeah, but, but, you know, authentically. Nice job. I appreciate it. Thank you.

Was very interested in in machines and. Um, mathematics and all the things that are skills that are required for an engineer. So it was really quite fortunate that it was evident to me at a young age. It wasn't entirely clear to me how. I would apply what I was interested in, what I thought were skills that I had. Um. I started out in electrical engineering because of this interest in music that I had the sound reproduction. He's also interested in airplanes and aviation. Long story short, I ended up pursuing a career. That employed boats, electrical engineering and aviation that was building. Electronic systems that perform guidance, navigation, control of airplanes.

"How to paint your room? Doing it yourself? First, you want to choose your color. Stop by figuring out the general color characteristics. Do you want a warm shade or cool shade? Natural saturated? If you have existing furniture or art, you want to take that into consideration. What will compliment it? Then you're going to need to pick your tools, your material. Every project is unique, but the tools will remain the same. Paint, paint, rollers, extensions, drop cloth, paint trays, sanding paper. You'll need painters, tape, rags, and a putty knife. Then you're going to have to determine how much paint you'll need. And the rule of thumb is generally for every gallon it covers 400 square feet, but that's just a rough guideline. Then you want to prep the room. Best to empty the room of all furniture, but if there's not enough space, you bring it to the middle. And then cover it with a drop cloth. Or like plastics, do the same thing for the floors, cabinetry, countertops, anything that could have access flatter. Grab a roll of painters tape and apply it to all the edges and corners. Then what you're going to want to do is mix your paint. Make sure it's little wooden spoon, make sure it's thoroughly mixed and you do it consistently throughout the project. Or you could have discoloration. Next you're going to want to do is um, figure out a technique. Generally best to work from top down from and then start from from with the ceilings. And if you're covering up dark walls you're gonna have to do several coats. I don't want you to forget about ventilation. Very important. Make sure it's well ventilated, opening up Windows, using fans, and last but certainly not least, clean up. Very very important. Remove all the painters tape, gather the. The drop clots and make sure spills and splatters are dry before you clean them up. Thank you.",6.0

"Alright, First off, picture yourself being on a bike. I know I'm just about everybody can can visualize that, but put yourself handlebars first and you're on your pedals and you don't want to be on your seat, you want to be standing up a little bit. Visualize that. Just writing down the street, right down the street. OK, so from that point, imagine there's a big ramp in front of you. Now if you haven't hit a ramp before, not a problem. The biggest thing is speed, and today we're going to use a foam pit so you don't have to worry about the consequences. Of going too fast or too slow. So visualize this going down a hill pretty fast. Enough speed to where you feel frightened. That's the key. Enough speed to where you feel frightened. And imagine hitting that ramp. We're not going to back flip this time. Just measured hitting that ramp and feel what it feels like to be floating. Your first reaction is to correct right you want to stay upright, upright. That's your body's biggest reaction to a back flip. Well, it's not, it's not intuitive, but what we're going to do is we're going to stop your body's reaction and we're going to do nothing. So the first time you do this, I want you to think about going down the ramp again, pull up and then think about being free floating and landing on your back in the phone. Now that key, that rotation, landing on your back, everything is good. You're safe back, your bikes on top of you. So nothing to worry about. Um, we're going to do that a couple times. And the biggest key to this once you get comfortable with landing on your. Back you're going to think about where your knees are. So your knees are another big indication of what your body is going to do. And last, the most important is your head. So think about this one more time. Going down, going down, hitting the ramp. Think about your knees meeting your face right, pulling him up. And then take your eyes and look where your landing is. If you look to where your landing is, your body will rotate. It's a natural progression. Wherever your body looks, your head will go. So one last time, pedaling as fast as you can. Look nice, come up, look for your landing, and I guarantee you'll have a back flip by the time you try. Practice at a couple times.",6.0
"Hello, my name is Donovan of bride. I'm going to tell you how I got started in my career. So I started out. I was working in retail for all of three years when I was in college. I didn't have any idea what I wanted to do. I was riding my bike semi professionally, getting paid to cut back flips and do really dumb things that will tear up your body. So. Fast forward to understanding that I needed to do something different with my life more long term. And also. Doing something that I really loved, one of my friends mentioned machining. I had no clue what machining was. I was vaguely familiar that things were made, but not really in the aspect of how they were made to. I registered for a class Community College. As soon as I saw it, I was hooked. I saw my instructor put a piece of metal in a lathe and started removing material and I knew that this was something that would be interested in. Fast forward several years later, I worked for GE Aerospace and probably one of the best jobs I would say on the market. Aerospace is very interesting. I work with a lot of special processes and my understanding of how things are made is very profound. Um, make jet engine parts. How crazy is that going from nothing to something within a relatively short amount of time. And that is how I. Step from Lily pad to Lily Pad, gaining information along the way to finally ending up in a job that I really, really love. It satisfies me. I understand that there's room for advancement. And and also I could see myself staying in this career for. At least another 10 to 20 years. So thanks. Have a good day.",4.0

"Hello, my name is Robert Donovan McBride. I'd like to talk to you about what I think. The world should focus on more from my perspective. I believe that we do a horrible job at reusing facilities. Plastic. Really anything that's. Made. I think the concentration is really based on. Manufacturing. Being in manufacturing myself, I understand that there's a lot of scrutiny and a lot of rigor around how to make something more so than how to save something if. If I were to be in a position of influence, I would incentivize. Ideas on how to reuse things? Simple stuff from like all the plastic in the ocean can go from just in the ocean collecting it to creating a new type of insulation. And this installation we could build a new buildings that would improve the thermal values, so therefore reducing the amount of energy it takes to heat or cool. The structure. Another thing that I would like to see would be creative uses for old spaces and this trans happened a lot more recently, but. It's not as prevalent as I'd like to see it. Again, the scrutiny is on new, new make, new buildings. If we could understand how to take what we've already put time and effort into spending. Um, time and effort into building and revitalizing that using products that we already have available or recycled goods to revamping and creating new structures within structures we already have. I think the world would be a better place and I would love to see the scrutiny put on reusing rather than new make stuff. Even though that's. What we concentrate on. Thank you. Bye, bye.",5.0

That decline in confidence would occur abruptly as most crises of confidence to. So the decline in America's capacity to borrow at affordable rates would occur suddenly. The CBO assumes that interest rates would rise gradually. In response, growth would contract contract, inviting the prospect of pronounced recessions. And even, possibly, depression.

The algorithmic strategy rack was Co developed and Co owned by Purging and convergex. In 2016.

"Long nights in the waiting room, summer vacations, cross country plane rides. Quiddler has gotten us through all of that. It's the game of short words, but I like to describe it as a cross between Remi and Scrabble. The game is played with a deck of 118 cards, including all the letters of the alphabet. Plus there are some double letters, so like I, N or TH. The object of the game is to have the most points at the end of eight rounds. The cards are shuffled and dealt to each player and just start with a different number of cards each round. The first round is 3, the second is 4 and so on up to 10. After the cards are dealt to each player, the dealer flips one card over to start the discard pile, and they placed the remainder of the deck in the center of the table in a pile and flip one card up as the drop as the draw card. Players begin. With the dealers suppliers with the player to the dealers left, they can choose to either pick up the face card from the top or the top card from the pile. Looking at their cards they determine what words they might have or get. Their turn ends by discarding one hand from their pile so that they start with the same number that they end with the same number they started with, and play continues in this manner until one player can go out. So what does that mean? It means you can use all your cards to spell. Either one word or two words, or three words, depending on the number of cards in the hand. You have to be able to discard one card to go out, so you have to end with the same number you started with. Once the player has gone out, each player gets one more turn to do the best that they can with the cards that they have in their hands. At the end of the round, players add the points on the cards they have, so you'll see that there are different point numbers just like there are in Scrabble, and that is their score for the round if they have unused. Those points are deducted from the total for that round, even if that makes your score go -. 10 point bonuses are also given at each round for the longest word and the most words. You can't use proper nouns, can't use hyphenated words or abbreviations, and play continues until the end of the eighth round with 10 cards in your hand, it's recommended for ages 8 and up, but it can be played.

If you're forcing them to learn signs or Max for which they don't have any interest at all, that will be a big disaster. Instead, a child who is very good and learning different languages, if you don't, make sure that the child is given different opportunities to learn more about such languages or explore other languages. There should be some elective options within our education system which would understand, or there should be some aptitude test return. Given to the students so that you can understand what they're really good at and nurture them in that direction. It's not just about learning old things.

Then you add two to three drops of vanilla Essence onto it, beat it very nicely so that it becomes very fluffy. Don't forget to add a little bit of like almost like 4 tablespoons of milk onto it and again make it a very good mixture.

So this is something that I think, in my humble opinion, that the. World should be focusing a lot, providing education to people, because if you see especially on. In all countries that have really poor people, people that don't have access to education. They don't know what to do. You know. They don't know how to survive by themselves because they don't know how to read. They don't know how to write. They don't know how to do MFS. They don't know how to ask something. They don't know their rights. You know, this is something unbelievable. This is really, really unbelievable. People that don't know their own rights. So This is why I.

Fan, cushion, bed, anything. Very simple words. The eh Fit member of the team looks at PICS award and looks at the world except for the guesser, and they go one by one, giving a clue for that word. With only one word, you are not allowed to skip your turn, you're not allowed to repeat a clue, and you go on until the guesser guesses the word. For example, for kumbor, one person to start will say green salad seeds. And if the person guesses, then you move on to the next word.

That broker dealers have to force settlement of failing trades. So what does that mean or how does it work? Well, it starts first with ensuring your counterparty that is failing to you, failing to deliver to you knows it transaction. Once you get them to know the transaction, then you could actually drive their results that you want through this buying rule and. Failed trades are very risky because you have counterparty risk, you have market risk, you have various risks that the business needs to manage to ensure that they're protecting our clients needs by receiving into securities in custody, custody in them for the clients. The buying notice goes out, it's a it's a legal document. It's considered an important document and and the first step in the notification process.

You can actually take action and adversely impact them through a market action and executing a buy.

"Good afternoon. I'm here today to teach everyone how to make Italian style Neapolitan, actually Neapolitan style ragu sauce. There's many, many ways to make tomato sauce, but Ragu has to be very specific. Ragu means that there's actually a protein or meat component to the source as well. And. It's debatable. You know what type of meats people like to use. Some people like to use pork. Depends what type of pork. Some people who spare ribs, some people use chops or loin, other people like other people like beef. The most common is people put meatballs in there, tomatoes in there, Ragu. Meatball I would say is probably the most common. There's some other meats like sausage, processed meats, uh, burgle, but. However you want to make it, it could be as simple as a. You know, throwing in a hunk of top round sirloin. So how do we start? You know, really a lot of this is preparation. Once you prepare it, you know, the cook time is. The duration of The Cook Time is the longest part of the process, obviously, and tending to tending to the to the Ragu is. Is very important, and I'll get to that later as to why. So we'll start by, you know, preparing our protein. And some people like to make the meatballs ahead of time. Uh, there's, you know, some people will bake them, right, which is probably the most, I would say, healthy way of of making meatballs or cooking meatballs. Other people like to fry them and when you do fry them should be specifically in olive oil, right? Olive oil is one of the key components to the ragu or tomato sauce. Uh and and and gives it a lot of its flavor. So we'll start by, you know, heating some olive oil in a frying pan. Enough to cover about. You know half of the meat at a time, or protein at a time. Once the oil is hot, you you start by searing the. Searing the meat doesn't have to cook all the way through, but you want to get a nice sear on whatever you're cooking, whether it be a piece of pork, steak, meatball.

I would say manage their expectations over what the youth players expectations are so. I think.

"Eh Hiren, I would like to teach you about how to play cricket. I'm not sure if you are aware of cricket. Cricket is a game which is popular, quite popular across the globe. So I would like to teach you in a minute. So cricket is a game where you play with the ball. Baseball and a bat which is kind of three feet long and. And so how it is done is like a baseball, the bowler will take the ball and throw the ball onto the batsman. So there will be a strip on the center of the ground. It's an outdoor game where the boundary would be the circumference of the ground. And on the center there will be in rectangular strip where you know that's properly flat and and you can actually bowl with the ball there. Like you run and kind of rotate your arms and bowl there. And the other end, the batsman would be holding the bad like a baseball bat and then. They try to hit the ball as hard as possible. If it goes beyond the circumference of the ground, it's considered as six. And if it rolls over the carpet and hits the boundary, so then it's a four, four runs. If it doesn't go anywhere and what what the bathroom can do is hit the ball and run. So they'll be a partner on the other side and the partners will cross. And once they cross and reach the opposite ends, it'll be called one run. And if they kind of do it multiple times, so then the runs. Keep counting like the baseball where you know you take that four sides will become one, right? So and likewise there are options of getting out when I say out. So if the batsman hits the ball in the air and the field is in the field catches the ball, then that person is called caught out and if the ball hits the weekends. So unlike in baseball, in cricket you have 3 wickets, 3 wooden logs placed in the center of the pitch on either side, and when the bowler balls, the ball hits the wicket. So then it would be out. So I think my time is up here. So that's it.",6.0

We did a market evaluation how good they are, how strong they are, what people they are. So then eventually we shortlisted 4 companies out of which there is this one company which came on the top from a patent portfolio standpoint, product standpoint and a future standpoint because their products were quite good to expand if we get that portfolio entire. Portfolio, so then our products will get award as the. Data is growing more and more. So they had this upgradability functionality where they can do a lot of analytics on top of the data. So eventually. The legal counsel. Gamer, go ahead. And the transaction was completed and we were very critical in enabling the business to acquire that particular company.",5.0

We want to release a product which is far better than competitors products, multiple competitive products. And our product Blacks good features. So what our team did was we did some research on who are out there with different unique selling points. So we shut it down. We got the top four companies including the major and minor and then we listed only the two minor companies. And those two minor companies have been further assessed from UM patent portfolio and also the product features they got and also the future scalability features if there are any. So then we eventually did uh due diligence. To acquire them, thereby enabling the business to get that competitive advantage and then release the product into the market with a very good set of features and compete with other people.",
"Hey. I would like to talk about the climate change and it's. Consequences on planet Earth and also impacting our livability for our future generations. So if I were to talk about some facts on the increase of the population over the years, like if you see go back to 50 years or 100 years and then you see here the population is increasing. And in some countries, the population is exploding. So, having said, the consequences of the population increase will increase the usage of so many pollutants like the cars, the vehicles and they. Emit lot of emissions which are kind of you know increasing the temperature and thereby affecting the entire climate of the earth and it's really like deteriorating the ozone and the lot of you it is coming inside that's that's definitely helping, that's not helping many people at all. So what I'm trying to say here is countries have to come forward like Europe came forward for a big project on hydration, sustainable as a sustainable fuel. Where their funding a lot of money to universities, the companies to work on can we make airplanes? Being fueled by hydration, so likewise big countries should also come forward and. Motivate many people to start researching on these technologies, hydration or any other technology which would not emit a lot of emissions. Ah, to be incorporated in the products that we all use. Thereby our future generations can live safely and happily.",5.0

It all started like 100 years ago when G. Um manufactured their first engine and then they kept on improving and then comes the CFM engines, which are like one of the best in the industry. And and then now comes the lead and afterwards G9X and Gen X. So it has really changed over the years. Is about the climate mitigation or climate change mitigation. So G as a company have started to. Research on sustainable fuels, which can reduce the emissions and thereby, you know, helping the planet. For. Healthy. Future generations. So we're working on some things like hydration related technologies for combustion as well as fueled aircraft. Um, so I would say this are going to be the key cutting technologies going forward?",

"Hello. I'm going to talk about something related to my work that is about how to deliver uh engine that is our core business. Sometimes it's hard to think about. When you buy something, you pay for it, then you'll get it and it's something you buy in the store or in the supermarket. However, for a big object and high valuable product like aircraft engine. It could be quite challenge to deliver it on time. And that is some techniques or tips. You may learn from it when you deal with different customers. So Wing engine is sold through a deal and customer place the order than the OEM as us we are going to produce it and we have aligned the target delivery date. However, we know the engine to pass all the tests and make sure the engine is meat or the targets. It could be sleep, I mean many times engine could be found some quality issues or fund is not passed the tests um and need to make some rework or even the work is delayed due to shortage of the material. So when it happens you have to deal with customer how to align on the delivery and how to make the adjustment of the timing. And on the other hands, customer may have the issue as well even the engine is ready but customer said oh sorry I don't have enough cash to pay for it to get the delivery. So you also need to help him to get the financing support from the bank or frontal assault to help him out and two ways the document to support that kind of. Activity.

Once we run the engines, so we it is possible that we can have some kind of debris coming out from the engine and by just looking at that morphology of the those chips, I just need to understand what is going on inside the engine and measure it is harmful or benign.

"Hi everyone, good morning. Today the topic that I have chosen is global warming or long period of time. It is observed that you know the temperature of the earth is rising and this is affected the wildlife, animals and humans and every other living Organism on this earth. Glaciers have started melting. Many countries have been experiencing water shortages, flooding, erosion and all of this is because of global warming. No one can be blamed for this except for humans, human activities such as. Gas is released from power plants, transportation and deforestation has resulted in the increase of gases like carbon dioxide, CFC's, methane and other pollutants in Earths atmosphere. The main question is, is how we can control the current situation and build a better world for future generations? How we can accomplish sustainable development. So it's starts with little steps by every individual. Like you know we can start using cloth bags instead of plastic ones that we just throw away for shopping purposes then instead of using normal. You know the incandescent lamps. We can use energy efficient LED lamps and then switch off electricity when we're not using. Don't waste water then any. Abolish any deforestation. Try to come up with. More like a plantation drives and all of that. And then shift the use of energy from petroleum and other fossil fuels to win solar. Maybe nuclear is an option. Then instead of throwing away, you know, old clothes that we have, we can donate it to someone else. So that's this. Recycled it spends more time being used. And then donate old books. Try to recycle paper as much as possible so we're not wasting it. Above all, like spread awareness about. Global warming. So every little thing a person does contributes towards saving Earth and finally it'll add up. So it's important to understand that even 1% effort is better than no effort. So today we should take a pledge to take care of our Mother Nature and speak up about global warming.",6.0

But also countries need to be more didn't like being able to be self-sufficient on the energy they have. By doing this we can control our own costs, we're not dictated to by other people and we become more self-sufficient.

"Do you know what it's like to fly? Well, I do. A few months ago I thought I really want to try paragliding, so I went, did some training sessions and now I can go up and paraglide wherever I want. So to start with, what you need to do for paragliding is join a club Finder, an instructor, and they will teach you everything you need to know, and within you know a short space of time you can learn to fly like a bird. There's less than 1% of the world fly in uh in free flight, and I'm I am part of that. So first you learn how to inspect the wing, you know, make sure the conditions are right, and then after that you will take your first hops, you'll connect up, and then you start jumping over a small. A small decline and a small hill, and then you'll get your air. Get some air. After that, you know, move on slightly bigger and bigger hills and within a couple of training sessions you're out flying as you know, couple 100 meters above the ground. Ah, so you've got your. You know you're connected to your. Um wing and that's connected through rises and then you've got your brakes and usual breaks to move with some weight shift. And then you know you're flying around. You maneuver around the round through the sky. Yeah. You have to take off into the wind and you have to land into wins, same as airplanes.

"I work for a company called dirty propellers who are part of the GE Aerospace Company. So we make hello blades for aircraft that fly through the sky and these are about 33% more efficient than, you know, normal jets. And one of our, you know, ways to make it more sustainable is to reduce our scrap and, you know, make sure that everything that we put effort into is right first time and it can fly. So, you know, since Daddy started making power blades, we've had a problem with wrinkles and their WAVY fibers that can cause. Yeah, knockdown since in stress levels. And I thought that was down to our phone processor. We shoot foam into the middle of our blades and that expands and fills the cavity. I want to change your foam. Changed him out from that we put in. But engineering were really against it. They didn't want to change it. Ah, so um. After a long hard fought battle, ah, we actually I managed to convince everybody to change the foam ah, which you know we ran for a year just to see what it would be like and we actually increased our yield from 75% to 95% in that one year. So that saved around £500,000 in cash that year from reduced scrap rate which is incredible. You know this problem has been around for many, many years and it's always been something that's really hurt out here. And now we have a better system, a better way of making the blades. So we scrapped less and we can deliver better to the customer.",5.0
"Half million pounds. That's why I saved last year by doing some process improvements. So to give you the back story, we inject foam into the center of our composite propeller blades that flying aircraft and hovercraft. They yeah, this foam expands and then it cools down and contracts a little bit and then pulls those fibers a tiny bit. I wanted to change the foam, the amount of foam that we put into the blades to make it better, to try to reduce this defect. It took some convincing. Some of our engineering colleagues didn't want to. Want to do it, but I persevered, got it through and you know did a production run for a year and ultimately we said £500,000 of cash that year. It was a huge saving for the business and we were able to deliver to our customers better.",

Alaska is a very cold country, very extreme weather. They have very limited. Maintenance crew on the ground. The aircraft was grounded. There was no way they have manpower support and it came to us. The G team work closely together. Brought in our internal resources. Help the airline to do an engine change in Alaska very extreme air condition. And the theme was able to go back into service in three days. In three days may seem like a pretty short time, but to an airline? It makes a whole lot of difference. Everyday flying an airplane means revenue for the airline. What I want to tell you is not about. Another line making money or how great we are but messages?

"Hey Eric, do you know how do we how GA vision makes money? So there is a perception among the among the people that like we make money by selling a new engines. But that's not true. We hardly make money when you sell engines. We almost have a break even like we don't. We don't even have a break even for until almost 1314 years in the from the entry in service of the program. So the wave G aviation makes money is by selling the spare parts. By providing the services. So if you look at the G Aviation portfolio. 80% of our revenue comes from the services. So. And how do we make the money from the services? You basically sell the spare parts or you have a long term services agreements? With the airlines wherein whenever engine requires any maintenance. GE takes the responsibility of providing the maintenance, repair, overhaul of the engines. And we charge the customer. On a power by hour basis. You fly X number of hours and then we're going to charge you like you know the X number of hours, times or rate. It's $100 per hour or $200.00 per hour. So I ah, the airline starts flying. Generating their revenues, we want to take some of their revenue portion to GE. So that's how you know we provide the services on the engines while airlines start flying them. And while they are start generating revenues, so we charge them um power by hour basis. So that's how like 80% of our. Having you on the profit for G aviation comes through the services. So.

"Today we're going to talk about how to make brownies. Brownies are yummy and amazingly tasted, but only if you do it in the right way. The first thing you want to do is you want to identify a place in your kitchen where you're going to have room to move around, and you want it also to be pretty close to the oven. So normally a countertop or kitchen table that is in the kitchen, you don't want to. For example, you don't want to start making brownies in your living room or dining room because it can get a little messy as that really appropriate. So first thing, you want to find a space in your in your. Kitchen the second thing you want to do is you want to Preheat your oven. You're also going to want to make sure that you have all of your ingredients and all of your equipment that you're going to need in order to make your brownies. Now, equipment. What do you mean? Well, you're going to need a bowl. You're going to need a pan to put it in, your going to need something to stir them in. In terms of ingredients, you're going to need your eggs, you're going to need your brownie mix, and if you wanted to throw in anything extra in terms of fudge, you're nuts. You're going to need that as well after you mix all of your ingredients and you're measuring from. Normally just following them on the box it's pretty simple. Put all the ingredients together, you mix them up. He laid it in the pan and then you put it into the preheated oven. After you put it in, the preview died of, um, you pretty much. It's just a setting and wait until it's done. But you do want to check it every couple of minutes to test to see where it is. How do you check it, you ask? Well, let me tell you, you want to take a fork or you want to take a toothpick or something, or a knife, and you stick it into the brownies. If it comes out clean, guess what? You're done. If it doesn't come out clean, that means that it's still not done and it still needs a little bit more time to bake. But guess what? Once that thing comes out clean and you're good to go, the next thing you need to do take out the brownies and you want to let them cool. Never go in and just your brownies right away 'cause you could. Turn it on 'cause it's a little hot, so guess what? After you taste it, you turn off the oven and you clean up your spot and then you're good to go. And guess what? You just made brownies.",6.0
"Today I want to talk to you about how to navigate your career within being Y Mellon. Why would I be the person to talk about how to navigate your career? Well, first of all, I've moved the company for 15 years and in that time I've held five different roles in three different line of businesses, each increasing and responsibility and moving me closer to the top on my career journey path. So I guess you could say I'm pretty well versed in knowing how to navigate. Yourself or your career rather through the company and the first thing I want to share with you, I'll give you 4 main Capel ways on how you would do that. Being good at your job is just not good enough, right? Because essentially everyone on your team is good at their job. And if you're good at your job and the person next to you is good at your job, when it comes to being promoted, how are you gonna separate yourself and set yourself apart from work? I don't want to see your competition, but rather your colleagues to show that you were the one who should be promoted when essentially everyone is doing a good job. Well, difference between extraordinary and ordinary is that little extra. But extra doesn't always necessarily. Need to be in the terms or in the format of working extra hours of doing actual work. It could be look like this. You could get a mentor. You could get a sponsor, you could start to expand your network, you could volunteer, you could take a leadership role in one of our ER be ****** you could. All of these things will help you to expand your network and to show other people what it is that you're capable of doing in and outside of your Direct Line of business and or team. And by doing that, you're showing more people what it is that you're capable of doing. And now more people have your eyes, more people. No, you more people could speak to you so you can inadvertently create some new sponsors who could back you up and work on your behalf to help you navigate your career and can pull you to the next level. So those are my four key takeaways and had to navigate your career within BNY Mellon.",5.0
"When it comes to navigating your career, there are four main things that you need to realize and these key points in time out to share with you or the things that are going to take you from being ordinary to extraordinary.

And I'll even take that sentiment in step further and say it's not what you know or who you know, but more so who knows you and who could speak to your accomplishments when you're not in the room and that means a sponsor. Second thing is get a sponsor and or get a mentor. Both of them can help you navigate your career by exposing you to new people and talking about you to decision makers who can make decisions on your behalf. The third thing I would suggest is that. Volunteer. Volunteer with our ER, geez so that you can network and meet more people. And the last thing I'll share with you is that you want to try to play in your career. Plan your work, and work your plan. Knowing what you want, what you need to do with skills that you need, and checking off everything in every box of one of those skill sets on your career path will help you get.",
"I think that the world needs to pay a little bit more attention to technology. How we use it and what we use it for? Is it a blessing or is it a curse? When you think about technology, there are a lot of. Good. Things that come along with it in terms of increasing how fast that we could do certain things, including the access that we now have, an access can actually be a positive and a negative. For example, I have three children, three small children, ages 85 and three. And my kids have had a lot more exposure to many things that I never would have had an opportunity to be in spose to when I was their age. Because in my day we didn't have tablets, we didn't have computers. Well, we had computers, but they weren't as accessible as they are today. The blessing is that now if anyone has a question or doesn't know anything, they could say hey Alexa, or they can Google it. When I was in school we had to go and look at an excellent uhhh encyclopedia or we had to go to the library or create a look things up to find things out. So it was a lot more difficult. So technology does have its benefits in terms of cutting down time, being providing access to a lot of things. The downside to all of this access is, like I said, my kids have access and they don't need to do the research or find things out anymore, but they could accidentally hit something or Papa come up and it's showing content. It's a little bit inappropriate. So then you have to use more technology to make sure that you can strip out that information or you could block it so that it doesn't pop up. But then there's only but so much that you could do when something's always seem to sneak through. And for those reasons, I feel like technology does have a negative side to it as well when it comes to access at least.",5.0

"Weren't everyone today, I wanted to give you a quick update on your service level agreement. And you might be wondering, this might be your first time seeing this report. This is a contraction report that purging provides to you to provide insights into how Persian is performing. Our systems are performing in actually also we provide some insight into operations on your team and our team. So in the report, as you see here, it's 30 pages long. Well, let's do a quick summary on the first page. Any misses that occurred will be on the first page. And then as we go through, you'll see it goes through operations, technology and then statements and confirms. So jumping quickly into the operations piece, you can see Pershing was 99%. Four checks, journals and fed funds and unfortunately we were 98%. For account transfers, as you may be aware, there's a few system issues and the lack of resources over the last month. 'cause some delays, um, so we didn't miss that one. We will follow up and provide you the exact issues. There are 1010 account transfers that were late. Moving onto the technology availability, you know gets complicated but high level the system was available in 99.5% of the time there was a one day outage which occurred. This is due to a third party. Pershing did choose that third party. So we decided to reduce our availability and so that is the update on the report we will send out the. Specifics on the outage and on this account transfers which were processed late.",5.0
"Hello everyone. Uh, they only give me one minute. So I'm going to give you a quick update on 3 reports you can use as the CIO and CEO of your firm to quickly evaluate purging how we're performing and you could also quickly see how your employees are performing and how Persian technology is is working over the month. Number One USA report is your contractual report. This is good for third party vendor governor management.

"Good morning, everyone. Today I wanted to give you a quick update on what Pershing does and why it's so valuable to the financial market and to the financial technology market. Currently, person has over 800 clients with over 1 trillion assets under management. You might think of purging as the backbone of the New York Stock Exchange and the backbone of the advisors that millions of clients visit every day. The reason why Port Persian is so important is we do the balancing in the reconciliation of all the trades for the 800 clients and millions of customers. By doing this, we have over 5000 employees, 3000 in Chennai, 2000 in the US. And we have a automated system for trading, for validating those trades, for validating trade breaks. We also have multiple applications available which are add-ons to our key application net X360. The next 360 is available on your laptop as application. It's also available through the mobile application and through websites. Again though, the key piece today I want you to take away is that these broker dealers, for example Citibank, Northwestern Mutual do not have the time other resources. Or the technology in place to handle millions of trades. That's what Persian is here for. Persian is here to provide the integration you need. And the subject matter expertise to make sure that your clients have a seamless transaction with their advisors.",5.0
"33,000. Please think about that number for a second. Is that a large or small number? 33,000 is the number of points that Michael Jordan scored in his career. He is currently the second largest scorer in the NBA. Kareem Abdul Jabbar has 50,000 points. Both are very large numbers. If you think about the average player averages 10 points per game. Now, taking into consideration Michael Jordan play for 20 years, he actually retired and then come back and play again up till he was 40 years old. Still a great accomplishment. Um, still one of the best basketball players ever. Not only for the points he scored, but for having five Championships, 5 championship rings. There's only three other players who had this Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and David Robson. Again, 33,000. Is a huge accomplishment. For any basketball player, much less one of the best basketball players ever.",4.0
"As an avid fisherman, I love to go on the water every weekend and catch mahimahi Wahoo, grouper and basically any big game fish he could think of. Now it is fun to catch and it is great to eat some good fish, but the the problem we're facing lately is the overfishing from other countries. Um, the big one is China. They actually come across you know, they go 1000 miles, they make a month long trip and they. The overfish the US borders, which not only impacts the US, but actually impacts the world in these fishery in the in the management of the. Despawning of these fish, one big thing I like to see is the Coast Guard and potentially Navy if they're available to really help monitor this type of fishing. I'm fine with the regulations for the US fisherman, but I really think we need a better job of helping police international waters to help the fishery get back to where it should be. The one last update I would give is I know that we have limited every year, sometimes their questionable but I do agree. So I think there should be harsher fines for these limits if someone keeps more than the limit allows.",
"Hi. So today I'm just going to teach you about various types of mutual funds, specifically load funds. So load funds, you have the ability to process purchases either at any V or for rights of a community, rights of accumulation. So there's certain situations where a client has the ability to purchase load funds at eh Navy and the most popular reasons are if they're part of a fee based model or some people call it a managed account and then there's also. Um. Folks that are employee eligible, meaning they're affiliated with a broker dealer for example. So those would be the two main reasons. When someone has has the ability to process a Class A mutual fund purchase at EH Navy then the other types of purchases are related to breakpoints. So breakpoints are can be a little bit difficult to understand but a front end load fund has various prices. You have the lowest price which is eh Navy and then the highest price. Which is ppop public offering price in between those two prices are called breakpoints. So as a client invests more into a specific fund family as they reach a certain dollar value in terms of investments, then they reach a breakpoint. So many funds, the breakpoint may for example start at 25,000 or 50,000, then the next one jumps to 100,250 thousand and then at a certain point typically it's around $1,000,000. The client will receive eh Navy and the advisor will will receive what's called a finders fee so the client no longer paying a sales load to the fun and they they can invest at the EH Navy at that level.",4.0
"So last year we introduced a new functionality that can be used by our clients related to processing their own mutual fund corrections. This gave them the ability to process their own corrections on their side instead of sending uh service Centers for the team to process. So this is greatly reduced the teams overall service center volume that submitted by our clients and has greatly reduced the exposure that. The firm typically is is at risk. So giving them the ability to process their own corrections has eliminated many phone calls that come into our queue. It has eliminated many inquiries that come to us. It has given them the flexibility to process everything on their side. They don't have to wait till they reach out to us and find out if the item has been processed. They don't have to wait on us to to to do it. So it really has created a more efficient process for us and. For our clients, it has reduced our overall volume by 50%. It has reduced the number of loss letters that we receive from our clients related to their corrections by over 85%. So this has been something that is has had a huge impact on everybody. It has given us the ability to focus on, on associates, more focus on career mobility and has greatly reduced the overall work volume that we're handling each day. It gives us the ability to have. Uh, folks, out of the office more often. You know, each day of the week and it. Has really given us the flexibility and has reduced the sense of urgency that's that's needed and reduce the overall stress of the associates.",4.0
"So mutual. Mutual fund corrections has been introduced to our clients that we gave them the ability late last year to process their own corrections on their side. This eliminated the need for them to send US service centers and to rely on us on to process them. So this has created a more efficient process for them. It has created a more efficient process for purchasing. And it has greatly reduced the number of service centers that could that come into our queue. It has reduced the number of service centers by 50% and has reduced the number of loss letters that we deal with and received from the fund companies by close to 90%. So this is something that has reduced risk, it has reduced the number of requests that receive and has reduced the stress of the overall stress of the department just due to the. Reduction in volume.",
"Education. I think this is one of the most important things that the world and our nation should, should be focused on, especially for the younger generation. The past few years, during the COVID pandemic, children's education was really um. A downfall, especially considering that many. School systems were shut down or everyone had to work remotely. So the children during this time period had drastic setbacks in terms of their education and within various subjects, whether or not it's the specific subject like say math or English, but also their social skills. So I think education being a major focus within our country, across the world, globally. Is something that really needs to be attended to. It's just that the last two years during the pandemic, some of our politicians decided to keep folks locked down, um locked in their home and they weren't able to attend schools and and just be with. Amongst. Others within their class, around their same age group. So I think this is something that really had a tragic turn on our children and has really just, um has has had a tremendous negative effect on them and I think they're just simply behind. So education definitely needs to be a focus. We need to get these kids back to where they should be two years at after the pandemic and hopefully. You know that there's a light at the end of the tunnel.",4.0
"Michael Jordan, the former NBA star that played for the Chicago Bulls in the late 80s and 90s. Um, would you believe that he scored a total close to 33,000 points in his career? This is something that is really astonishing considering the average player probably scores 10 to 15 points per game. Um, I believe Michael Jordan scored probably close to on average 30 points a game and to achieve. 33,000 points in his career is really just an unbelievable achievement and something that only a few can potentially achieve. Someone like LeBron James or cream Abdul-jabbar or Larry Bird, I don't think he even got to that point, but it's really just an amazing feat.",5.0
"Hi Pershing is eh bien Y entity and we are um clearing firm and we allow broker dealers to execute and process their transactions on our platform in order to. Support their clients for various products, equities, ETF's, mutual funds, fixed income products. So the the main. Thing that the company does is we provide clearing services, so are introducing firms have access to our system that allows them to submit orders or enter trades on behalf of their clients. So if we speak specifically to mutual funds, the platform offers close to 29,000 mutual funds across 800 fund families and this is. Involves both domestic and offshore funds. So in particular you know uh and introducing firm may have various reps and these clients instead of processing their mutual fund trades directly with the fund company, they could be on the Persian platform and have one one account with all of their positions consolidated on our platform. This avoids the client receiving very statements conference. From all different fund companies and they get everything from purging, so we are a clearing firm.",
"Good afternoon, all. I've set up this call today to talk about sustainability as it's a big part of all of our roles. And I think coming together on this call will save a lot of time in the future if we all just share ideas and come to a conclusion on how we move forward for the 2030 target. I believe there's two critical areas, one being carbon emissions and the other being supplier collaboration. As we all know, I've sent out a survey to our key suppliers last week in collaboration with ER, renewable energy supplier and. The feedback has been really good, although we've not heard back from over 60% of our suppliers yet, so this is also apostrophe to reach out, see suppliers and get them to fill in the survey. In the next two weeks. Could I get a body polar, everyone is on board with doing that. Just let me know what you think. Um, do the Microsoft Teams hand if you if you want to say a bit more than just a thumbs up or thumbs down? Oh, great. Thanks everyone. Yeah, that's much appreciated. The more feedback we hear, the easier it's going to be for us all in the future. So if you look at the slide behind me, you can see that I've picked up on trends for our suppliers and competitors on what they're doing on their sustainability. And then letter journey, I'd like to bring in Phil Beta the call as well, who's um as you all know is heavily involved with slab supplier collaboration as a senior buyer and he's also worked at ER in the past, so knows exactly what they are doing. Thanks for your input fill. Much appreciated. Now I'm going to do a breakout room. I'm going to put half us. In breakout room one and the other half in Group Breakout Room 2 and then. I want us all to discuss what we took from their session and also how we're going to move forward and then we'll all come back into the room and share our ideas. Um, please notes use concept board and provided in the link below just so that we keep we've got it all noted down, it won't take us long to go through. Great. Thanks all. How was that? Perfect. Um, so looking into the future, I think we should. Do this again and create a focus group just so the 21st target is in REACH and we're always staying on track. I think once um Um's probably OK um, but just before I go I want to get um. A thumbs up on that as well, please. OK. Yeah, we can do it once a quarter, I just thought. Once a month might be beneficial but like you say because the targets so far away and we've got a clear cut plan maybe 2330 at work. Thanks again for your um. Fila cooperation on the call. I think sustainability is a key factor to our everyday lives. As you know, um. And that's it really. Thank you.",5.0
"I absolutely love chicken parm. And I'm going to teach you how I make my chicken parm. So first I start with Nice fresh chicken cutlets and I openly pound them very, very thin. I then will salt and pepper both sides. I will flower them, bred them, and I will pan fry them to a golden brown. At that point I have already started normally fresh marinara sauce which I will put on top of the chicken Collins. I will then add a layer of fresh mozzarella and I will bake it in the oven for approximately 35 to 40 minutes at 375 degrees. I've noticed that by pounding the chicken cutlets prior to frying them always results in a much more tender and delicious end result to that meal. Again, I love to eat as you can tell, but chicken parm is one of my favorite dishes to enjoy and I absolutely love making it as well. I will make this for my family a couple times a week and it's quick, it's easy. You know, maybe it takes about all in an hour. And I would encourage you, if you enjoy, to cook and eat as I do, to maybe try this recipe. Thank you.",5.0
"In 2021. Equity allocation reporting became an industry focus for the consolidated audit trail. As a result. Myself and my team had to diligently work for one year with both internal external stakeholders to successfully develop solutions to be able to accurately capture and report to the consolidated Audit trail equity allocation trades that were booked onto the Persian platform. I'm happy to report that after diligently working with my team and all of the internal and external stakeholders that we successfully delivered a solution. That worked for both the firm and our clients to remain in compliance with this new equity allocation reporting requirement, which was mandated by the CAT in 2021.",
"In 2021. The industry moved to something known as the Consolidated Audit Trail for the reporting of equity allocations. This was a very large industry initiative and change for. What traditionally was known as trades processing. Within the financial services industry, as a result of this change, I lead a team that had the responsibility to make all system enhancements across the organization to be able to capture and accurately report to the Consolidated Order Trail, otherwise known as Cat, all equity allocations that were processed onto the platform. This took about a year to plan partnering with business SME's along with our technology partners to be able to accurately document the requirements, develop the systems and applications, perform the necessary business level testing and then deliver to production in time for when the regulation went into effect. Happy to report that after many months of planning and working with my. Internal partners and external stakeholders and some examples. We delivered the solution without issue and ultimately met the regulatory obligation and to this day continue to remain in compliance with. Equity Cat allocation reporting. So this was a testament not only to myself, my leadership skills, but also to all of the teams that I had to work with over the course of that year's, over the course of that year to successfully go and deliver a viable solution to the firm and to our clients.",6.0
"A topic that I feel the world should be paying much more closer attention to is the topic of renewable energy. So as we all are aware, fossil fuel continues to be the leading source of energy in the United States along with globally. The challenge with petroleum based products is that you have carbon emissions, which are. Adversely impacting the. Witcher adversely impacting global warming and overall the quality of air, water and our food due to the amount of carbon emissions that petroleum based products give off when they burned to create energy. So the focus obviously has been to see if we can. Create more. Uhhh, electronic vehicles and utilized batteries as opposed to petroleum based products. But the but the challenge there is that the technology ultimately is not there yet. So they're expensive, they are extremely hard to build and maintain and then on top of it when the batteries go bad, what do you do with them? You got to then go and bury them into the earth. So that's really not much better than. You know, using combustion based fuels. So in my opinion, I think that we need to kind of focus more on coming up with alternative energy, right? Some sort of a renewable energy, whether that's hydrogen or something else that has 0 emissions and is easy and inexpensive to create and then once it's past its point of useful life, does not become a natural disaster to have to then get rid of.",5.0

"Hi, everybody. Will, probably everybody's doing fine. So after EMM a, I'm going to jump onto my topic which is related to digitalization as well. It's regarding a digital logistics platform. But before I start talking about more into detail about it, I want to ask you a question. Basically. Quite a simple question. If I ask about any daily life, if you need to ship this pen for example. Let's get it up. How would you find out which company to use? How much it will cost? How much time it will take? Uh. For you to send it over. Anyone of you, maybe, Paul, if you don't mind me asking you. How? How would you? How would you find out? What would you do? Great. OK. Yes, you're right. It's a lot of times if we talk about our personal life, you Google it if you don't want our professional life. I did talk to a colleague or you talk to a person in the mailroom. Um, just perfectly fine. And that's that's the easier, the most convenient way we can think about of sending the goods out too, if we need to. So let me tell you something. We have been um. Spending a lot of time and effort to building a platform which is basically logistics platform, an end to end logistics platform if I may call it. Which not only allows you to select the right supplier for a service that you need, but also it gives you the option to make a choice based on. The speed which will be the quicker one to ship your goods. It will be the cheapest 1. And 3rd and most important I would say considering. Today's scenario since we do talk a lot about sustainability contributing to our environment. The third option is most green option, so you can actually circle select the folder which will have less you to mission to ship your goods. And when we talk more about it, it's not only about selecting the supplier for shipping the goods, it's also about it gives you the salt problem for the payment process as well as we know we have been having these payment issues with all our followers across all the commodities. So. Again, if EMM a if you don't mind me asking. Of this particular problem that we had in the past, can you think about any other tool or platform which you might have come across from your experience which is providing end to end solution? We know we have several tools available in the Siemens world outside in the market, but just from your experience, maybe everybody else in the room as well. Feel free to give your feedback that if you have come across a tool. Which is basically an end to end platform and provides that solution. Exactly. So that's that's what I was expecting because and the reason I I knew the answer because we did that research in the beginning of the project and we knew there is no such end to end platform which solves that problem which we are trying to solve. So the good thing is we almost done in terms of testing the tool, creating the functionality that we wanted to as per the requirement of Siemens UK. So. Be ready, watch out for the space it's going to be launched. I will share the links in the chat after this meeting where you will find one from mission by the tool and it will be launched on 10th of November. So watch out the space on Yammer and you will find all the information that you would need to and it's really going to be interesting, believe me.",5.0
"OK. Welcome back, everyone. Before the break, we watched this really cool video on digitalization in the wider world. And before we go on with that, I just want somebody in the room. Could you just tell me one thing from that video that resonated with you? Yeah, that's a really good point and we now want to go one step further. So we talked about a funnel before who are right at the top. We're now going to take the next step down through this funnel. And look at how things are going to affect us in procurement. So. Let's have a look around the room, let's let's get our fingers up everyone. And I want you to tell me on a scale of 1 to 10, one being were not very future proof at all, 10 being we are so ready for the future and procurement. How good is procurement have ready is procurement for? Digitalization and for the future in general. Things up. OK. And Paul, could you just have a look around the room for me and see what do you think the average is? About 6:00 so were close, but we've we've got some way to go, let's say. Now. I just want to show you an example of this, so can somebody tell me what this is? It's a phone, yeah. More sort of phone is it? An iPhone? If I was to ask you what version of iPhone this is, could anybody tell me? Could maybe take a guess. But I bet you wouldn't know for sure. Now there's been 14 different versions of this. But it doesn't really look that different. And that's how things are a little bit in procurement. We have a lot of these digitalization things coming into procurement, but. We don't really see too big a change. You might see it if you're really involved in it, but from slightly further out you don't see it and that's what we want to work on in the rest of our session today. So we're going to look at two things, two things in the first. It's the impact digitalization will have specifically on our function and we're going to that in a little bit of detail later on. The second thing. New roles within procurement. So we have our standard roles, but going into the future, what what changes might we see, what what's going to be different and what might not be there? Nose. And we've got a really cool exercise that we're going to go into. And yeah, I really hope that that you enjoy it. And I'm going to hand over now to my colleague who's gonna put you into some groups and take you through the exercise that we're going to do.",5.0

Driving is a necessity skill in today's world, but we have to be careful that we do not meet with in any accident. Today I'm going to teach you how to drive a car. In order to drive a car.

And. When you're comfortable, then you are ready to start your car. So either you have a ignition with a key or with a push button you start your car. Before starting the car, one thing we forgot was to make sure that the vehicle is in neutral. Once you have put your vehicle in neutral. And you have started the car. You slowly press the clutch with your left flute and move your. Gear to the drive mode. So. Once you have put the gear into the drive mode, slowly release the clutch. At the same time you have to press the accelerator so the car starts moving. When it starts moving, you have to make sure that you are. Steering it in the right direction using the steering wheel.

Collected from the customer and based off that we analyze or we come to what is the health of the contract. Based on that, the leadership takes an action if that particular contract is not doing well. Or if it is doing well, leadership takes into account how to make sure that this contract remains profitable. This is an important step.

"Alright, so today I'm going to teach you. How to cook one of my favorite dishes. It's called lamb surprise. I don't have any name for it so. It's something that I just came up with when I was learning how to cook in Cincinnati by myself. I have learned a few different techniques, but this was the first time I was trying something different. So what do you need? You're gonna need lamb chops. Two of them. Now you need some Portobello mushrooms. You're going to be very large ones 'cause those are the best. They have a lot of Labor. You're going to need. Oil. Arugula. You don't have that. Just speak back, burglar. And the key gradient? He's whining. So you need one glass of wine for yourself. To make it taste better and think, you're gonna need a glass wine to go in there. And you're going to cook. The pork chops are going round EMM on both sides. You know, make sure that everything is very sealed. After that. You're going to add the Portobello that you have a slice already? Into it. Those are going to get you a little bit of a rich flavor, earthy flavor. You're gonna let them cook medium high heat. You don't want to hire, you want to kind of in the middle. If you're gonna add their arugula next after 5 minutes, 5 or 10 minutes and then you turn off the heat. And you're gonna let us see. Well, that's cool. Well, that's simmering. Or at lower level. You're going to cook some white rice in your rice is good. That's mighty chest Jasmine, long grain mute, brown writes. And then you're going to make sure that you don't forget the wine and you put it back in there. So you might have to heat up the. Lamb again.

"Titanium is one of the most important components on any aircraft, engine or airplane. It's lightweight, its corrosion resistant and it's incredibly strong. However, nothing comes for free, and it's incredibly difficult to process titanium to make sure that it's. Safe and doesn't have any defects in it or. Anything that would cause the material to fail early. What are the key challenges? In making sure that you do that, especially now with all of the global supply chain issues between COVID and the Ukraine crisis, is ensuring that there are adequate supplies of titanium and the materials that go into titanium to make up a robust alloy that we can use to make aircraft engine components. One of the projects that I'm working on right now is making sure that all of our suppliers have all of the ingredients that they need to make titanium, all the raw materials. One of the main material suppliers for titanium worldwide. Previous to the Ukraine crisis with Russia. Since Russia is no longer allowed to supply material to the aerospace industry due to sanctions. There's been a mad scramble across the industry looking for new sources of titanium, looking for existing suppliers to ramp up production, and that's really strange, that supply chain. Specially with when there are many controls over what materials can be used and lengthy process is to get things approved. I'm working on identifying what new partners we need to start working with. And identifying the approval paths and starting to work through those approval paths. With each supplier to make sure that. We have a consistent high quality supply of titanium.",6.0
"Titanium is half the weight of steel, but just as strong. Because of this, it's one of the most important parts of any aircraft, engine or airplane. With recent supply chain challenges between COVID-19. And the Ukraine crisis? Titanium has been in relatively short supply lately. One of the main suppliers worldwide of titanium was Russia, which due to recent sanctions is no longer allowed to be used by manufacturers. As such, many people are scrambling to find new sources for titanium. Due to the high quality requirements that are required in the aerospace industry, there are many controls around what materials can be used to make up titanium alloys and components. That's involved with specific suppliers that have to be approved. The approval processes are very lengthy. One of the projects that I'm working on is making sure that we are looking for alternate sources and keeping robust supply chains open for GE aviation.",
"After fossil fuels used for power for things like coal power or gas for cars, what do you think is the most? Polluting carbon dioxide. Releasing. Item that poses a risk to the world today. I'll give you a minute to think. Do you think it's plastics manufacturing? After all, plastics are made out of oil, right? Start. It's actually cement and materials manufacturing. They make up a huge amount of the power that we need and the carbon dioxide emissions that are emitted into the atmosphere every year and it's really unique because it's a problem that we don't currently have a solution for. Every time they make cement, carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere and a lot of carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere. You think about the rapid pace of growth in China and the developing world requires a lot of cement to build houses and roads and buildings. And. Frankly, no one is making green cement right now, not even in Europe, where I'll say the most advanced green technologies are currently being adopted. There are some ideas around carbon sequestration in the material, so that you can essentially take atmospheric carbon and put it in the material. There's also ideas like going to electrolytic processes that use electricity rather than chemical processes to produce some sorts of metal. These processes in general are fairly immature, though there's a lot more investment that needed to go into these materials. It's really a problem that we need to focus on because even if we have 100%. Renewable energy, we still are using a lot of our CO2 budget to make materials.",6.0

And then dry roast your Lotus seeds in it. Just keep dry roasting it for about 15 minutes. The color should change a little bit. You should also notice that the crunchiness that it's it's getting. Uh, crunchiness. After 15 minutes or so, poor the the mix that you made-up in the beginning. How much butter you want to take is completely dependent on you based on the taste spiciness. You can adjust the chili powder or black pepper, but you just pour it in the pan over the roasted Lotus seeds and then mix it for another 4-5 minutes and that's it.

In other words, when you're building a data product, you need to think of not only the current use cases. You don't build a data product only for a certain use cases or certain consumers. You don't narrow it down sucking. You wanna have a data governance around it. In other words, you want to treat it as a product that would have a future changes to it and you want to monitor the changes you want to monitor with the consumers are who are the authors of the data. The 3rd is a linear edge, which means we want to always have a sequential image with the product. End of the day, should be a logical entity which would have a dedicated support. You can have uh multiple different types of product within that logical entity to support. But then each product for example you can have one for operational and one for.

"When you get on that airplane. There are certain things you want. You want it to be efficient. You want it to be fast. And you want it to be quiet. So. I get to work on how to make that happen. For the future. Air engines generate. If you remember from high school physics that force equals mass times acceleration. And for an engine. Thrust. The force of the engine is mass flow through the engine, airflow through the engine times. The change in velocity from coming in to going out. So you can have thrust with a little bit of air moving really fast. Or a lot of air moving slowly. It's more efficient to move a lot of air slower, so. The bigger the engine, the more efficient it is, but. What about that big duct you don't want? That's heavy and it's going to have drag. So the rise engine is an open fan engine without a duct. And so. How is it going to be fast? Because propellers aren't fast. But. We are designing it. To be fast as as a normal aircraft. How's it gonna be quiet 'cause propellers aren't quiet? But we're designing the blades so that they'll also be quiet. And is it going to be efficient? Yeah, because it moves a lot of air. Not as fast. As. Uh. A smaller engine.",6.0

A little bit of air, but making it accelerate really fast. Or a lot of air and having it accelerate less fast. It's more efficient to generate the thrust. With. A lot of air and less less acceleration. And that's how we make it. Efficient. Fast and quiet.",

"So I was laying under the car and I looked over. With a panicked panic across my face as I watched the hydraulic Jack fall as it failed. This is what just happened to me a week ago. It's why I have a. Brand new Jack coming, and it's why safety is the most important part. Of changing the oil in your car. So the first step for changing the oil in your car is you need to warm up the car. So that the oil comes out easier, then you have to Jack it up in the air. But you don't just leave it on a hydraulic Jack, you make sure you put Jack stands underneath in case. The Jack fails. Like it did to me. Then you remove the the oil, the. Bolt at the bottom of the oil pan. You let the oil drain out into a catch basin for all the oil. And then you replace that plug with a new crush washer. Then you remove the oil filter. And you? I like to personally fill it up with a little bit of oil to make sure it doesn't start empty. Reinstall that. Lower the car, remove the jackstands that hopefully just say, you know, may have just saved your life. And then lower the car and fill it up with oil. Usually use that you would use the amount of oil recommended in the manual car and the same oil type for the climate that you drive in. OK. I got 10 seconds left.",6.0

My team got the call to come up with some form of condition based monitoring. To solve this field failure. On the small team we went and. Created a found a lab. Uh, we found a sensor off the shelf. And designed all the electronics and the data system and the algorithms to process the data to find a way to monitor and catch potential blade cracks. On engines. GE Power then stood up an entire team. 2. Go out and retrofit fielded engines. With this instrumentation. And then created a whole team. To just write the software and do the condition based monitoring. Such that we could catch real failures in the field. And I remember getting the phone call. About six months after fielding the system, when they caught the first engine where the blade tip had begun to crack, it had lost a chunk of the blade about that big, and they shut it down.

"As I walk out to my mailbox each day. In this election season. And I grab. The mail out of the mailbox. It's always messages of fear. And US versus them? And those are things that high level, those two concepts that put people against each other and cause everyone to live their lives in fear. It feels like something that is bad for our society. And it seems like it's a global problem. The sad part is we always seem to respond to the fear. Whether that's human nature. And we always reward the people who. Create that fear. And that animosity and US versus them. See. So I I wonder how we as a society can improve. By rewarding the people that pull everyone together, that in improve our cultures, that bring everyone together. That seems like a. Society that would be happier. That would be less stressful.

"Hi. OK. So my name is Michelle and I am going to explain the plan for my team. I have five direct reports for them. Um are strictly day-to-day talent managers that lead different client teams. And then I have one other person that leads all celebrity negotiations. We all can do celebrity negotiations, but he is the lead. Um, the plan for the 2023 calendar year that I have is to make more effort of 1 on one time. Each individual as they all have different career paths and different goals that they have within the talent department. Currently we meet every Tuesday, um all of us and we kind of just like go over like things that we want to bring up client hurdles, client positive things, but I also want to be intentional of having one on ones moving forward. So I'm thinking maybe like a Friday like coffee chat type thing, make it more casual and so that I can really connect with each one outside of like a client issue or meeting. Um, so specifically with Nora, I want to continue to work with her on making sure that she uses her voice in meetings, is able to lead meetings, and also help her work on her presentation skills so we can start working on a talent 101 together and hopefully bring in one other person from our team as well. Um, our one on ones with April and Liz. I would want them to have some sort of like um. Path to continue to grow, to eventually like lead a whole city of clients possibly in the near future. It sounds from past in passing that that's something they wanted to do. So I'd really like want to focus on them and having real intentional client assignments so that they can make that happen in the future and then open to anything else they want. With Don. I want to work with her on, you know she's very like happy here she's. Voiced but she is looking more towards retirement so I want her to continue to give that knowledge back to our team knowledge exchange and help Nora and myself with the talent 101 as she has such a great wealth of knowledge and sad. Um with Gordon one and one. I want him to continue to help structure, uh, celebrity focus negotiation, um department and see if we need to like expand. What other resources do we need platforms to make everything more efficient. I want to make sure that he has the legal backup that he needs and as far as all of our team does well, the resources so that we can negotiate and redline these contracts affectively. And then I think by the end of the year, hopefully then that also helps that everyone feels like they have the psychological safety as we were taught. So they want to be apart of the team, apart of the agency and feel like fulfilled in their work moving forward.",3.0
"Hi so my philosophy for my team, I kind of um have tried to really. Ensure that there is psychological safety environment within my department. I've basically done this because of past experiences where I have not felt that way, so I know how it feels to not have be able to share my idea is or have uh, you know the good feeling about going to work that day or you know, being able to communicate freely with my manager. So I really just want to build a team where everyone. Can bring their ideas, have a really nice knowledge exchange. Everyone can be vocal and vulnerable about how they're feeling. Whether it's like, you know, I need a break from this client or I need some help or I need a day off. Like, you know, like really honesty and justice having, you know, communication between everybody, all six of us on anything that we need at any time. And honestly, I I've heard it first hand from my team that they love working with each other and really partner with each other and so that I feel like. Run the right path.",4.0
"Hi, Tyler. How are you doing, um? So our team. We have to work on some of the people's responses to emails. Like Gordon, I'm getting back to people. I think he just has a lot of he's in a different process of production than the rest of us are. And so he's kind of getting hit from every direction at different stages of urgency. And so I know for a fact that he is, you know, taking down notes and like has like A to do list. But I think that maybe, you know, it's almost too much. Maybe like we need somebody else. To help him, you know, whether that means like a full person or like me or Liz helping out with some of these deliverables 'cause I think it's just getting to be too much and that's affecting, um, you know, people. Feeling that they're not being prioritized by him, unfortunately, and I don't want that to be the case because as we both know, he brings a wealth of knowledge and we need to make sure that he is respected and given the proper amount of workload to be able to be a success here and not have anyone say anything differently. But the rest of the team is doing well. Nora's really stepped up when Liz was on maternity leave, which is amazing. She really. Started bleeding like the Wendy's team meetings, um. And she also started just like leaning in and volunteering to help anybody on the team that needed help. So she's really kind of like taking taking a step in the right direction as far as being more vocal on the team. Um, and actually surprisingly with lesbian attorney leave, it's been not too crazy. And Coke, I was little, you know, afraid that that was going to kind of go crazy. But because they didn't produce after June, really, we've been able to kind of like keep your head above water, but when she comes back in two weeks will be really happy just to have like more support on coke moving forward.",
"So my boss is ahead of production in North America and so he is responsible for all of the producers, all of the production business managers and all of my department, the talent managers. And he basically is there to make sure that every client has, if they need to produce a commercial that we have an assigned producer, production list manager and talent manager leading the way. He also is able to help with resourcing if we need to like hiring you. Talent managers producer is, if we like when a new client, he gets to build the team that's assigned to that that particular client to lead and he also is very involved in any new business pitches. And so like I'll work with him on you know ballpark in that sort of thing and seeing like is it sad nonunion. We work really closely together to execute that. The pitch, um. We also work together with creating processes. For instance, we have an influencer issues that we have within our department and so we're trying to work with other departments such as connections. My talent department just end with WP overall to get on a process in place so that we can support that type of process or that type of like. Business I guess you could say in general he also works with me closely on helping promote individuals on any staffing issues and Zach related issues. So he's just always available and just make sure that every client has coverage to produce commercials.",
"So I have to have a difficult conversation. May I? OK, so. I have Nora who has been not. Be you know, I've had to speak to her and let her know about Vocalising leading meetings, you know, not just doing the, AH, administrative type of work and she's just not delivering. And as a result, the rest of the team is having to lead meetings, set up the the trainings and do everything that she's supposed to be doing on clients. But they're having too, and they are also. Being resentful about it because now they're taking time out of their day-to-day eh clients to help hers and so that's obviously not fair. And also her role isn't become more admin and nature. So therefore we could hire someone that is not even at her level more junior to train them and to do it because there's no. Experience needed on the types of items that she's doing. So therefore, it seems like the common denominator here is to let her go. I mean, as a person she's she's great, but she's just not stepping up to be at the same level as the rest of the team. And she's seniors. So that doesn't sit well with everyone else because we can't. When I have a new client, I can't give it to her because she's not. Use the critical thinking skills, lead an onboard, train the the teams that are assigned and therefore I worry that that client is not get the full. You know. It's not to be taken care of to the to the same level of other clients. They're not going to get the same sort of on boarding and it's going to could be detrimental to the business and so therefore I just don't think she's a good fit any longer moving forward.",5.0
"So honestly, I don't know if I'm missing something, but this one I couldn't figure out what was the learning to explain what to tell the team to do. So I'm just going to say that we follow the directions we all pitch in as a team to try to be as efficient as possible and take anybody's ideas who might have to make us, you know, be successful and potentially be the winner. Um, at the end of the day, one of the things is like let's start like an assembly line. Like if somebody wants to be the lead to read the directions, somebody else, two other people maybe can be taking the things out-of-the-box. And you know, we can all kind of like tag team and just communicate efficiently. So if any like just, you know, using our words and trying to build this so that we can get the table all set up and ready to go.",4.0
"So the main focus for the next year for the Connections Health Team, social team is really about how do we make the team an integral part of the overall. Company right now we are seeing as more of a um assistance and Nice to have and the reality is that that's not how the industry is moving and that's not how the world is changing. So our objective and are my plan for the year is really focused on education and um integrating ourselves into what needs to get done. So the first step that we're working on is building out a capabilities. Jack, um, that is a little bit more in the weeds than some of the capabilities decks that we have right now, but really speaks to the health practice and why social media is so important for health. Um and what are the things that we can do and how we can help them and really helping them see us as how they actually can engage with us. One step for that is that we're working with some of the teams that we've partnered with um very well so far and. Using them to help develop the case study from the perspective of a. Uh CE person or a production person who works in those roles to help them understand exactly what it is we can do that will help make their lives easier and the work better across the board. The second thing that we're doing to improve that is using the. Uhhh standardizing some of the processes for the teams, so including developing standardized scopes that can be used as a jumping off point to save time and energy when we're developing a new project. Um, for the teams so that we can. Save them time as well as save ourselves time and energy. And then obviously anything that we do is going to be able to be customized and tweaked to fit whatever actually needs to get done. But so that way it saves them, you know, time and energy. And I think honestly by doing that, we demonstrate some of the value that we add, um, while we're helping them scope. And then thirdly, we're going to be setting up for the next year starting in January. Mapping out what of our projects that we see is being relevant for eh fees for other awards so that we can start documenting them as early as possible rather than waiting until the system is uh. Getting towards the end, um. And so we can get those and have them ready.",2.0
"My management philosophy really focuses on being able to find and identify the. Best skill sets of each of the employees that I work with and giving them the tools and the room to.

And I think as part of that, uh will enable me to be more hands off as well as them to grow.",4.0
"The focus on the team I think is in a really great place. We are really. Adding value to the projects that we're working on, I think as as you know, the biggest challenge is that those who aren't working with us, um, have a hard time understanding what exactly it is that we do and how we can be of value and honestly thinking ahead to how they can scope us into projects um, so. I think one of the biggest challenges and what we're working on developing is sort of the distinct health social capabilities because while we have um. Eh. Similar. Uh, focus too much of the social teams in the building. The reality is 99% of what the health practices doing right now is paid, and that is. So the focus that we have in kind of the, the global social practice as a whole on organic content, on developing content and um, live content is not really as relevant to them. So I think it's important that we provide that education and let them know about the capabilities. But I really want to help develop our social health capabilities to focus laser focus on what it is that they might actually be um. Be able to use us for in the next year or so as we and then use that kind of foot in the door to help push um beyond that to the new things that we can help with and I think that. We're in the process of getting that set up.",

He is largely responsible for ensuring that um, our team is getting uh, adding value and getting scoped into accounts, making sure that we're profitable, making sure that we are being. Uhhh asked to provide the right kinds of things. I think it's a little bit difficult and tricky for our team specifically because the. Efforts that most of the team is providing um is a little different from our practice. So I think the. What he's able to provide value on in the health practices a little bit more tricky because they aren't doing organic content.",
"So I know we've had a couple of conversations already about Zach and his performance. Um, I think we're all waiting to see what happens in the next um couple of weeks once he's back from his leave. I think the. Main um. Challenge and concern or the the decision I've come to is that I don't know that he has the gravitas and um, level of engagement that is necessary to be an associate director on this team. The reality is that. I have more junior employees who I can trust more without needing to handhold or babysit. Um and. That. Is a real challenge when his role was created, specifically to allow me to focus less on the day-to-day of specific projects and accounts so that I can focus on growing the team? Um, the. 1. Thought process or the one thought that I had was, um, potentially having a conversation with Jenn Kolanda. Conversation with him around whether knowing his background is really in media planning, knowing that that's an area that he does excel at, and I think he has an opportunity to provide value to the team in that way. If it would be worth having a conversation if that's an area that he's interested in continuing to grow.

Different pieces of the desk, we can identify which things can be made at the same time or which things can be need to be developed kind of in a waterfall process and then we can assign teams to that and kind of get going.

"Hello, my name is Kara Screen. In this video I'll be teaching you how to drive a motorcycle in 2 minutes or less. So First things first. Full gear. Make sure you have your helmet, gloves, jacket, long pants, something sturdy, denim, Kevlar on um Carhartt, any type of stretchy pants and boots that cover your angle. You want to be protected for your right, OK? First things first, it was the key to the on position pulling the clutch kick stand up starter on and then start the bike. So there's the the kill switch. Just make sure that the kill switch is on this ah flipping the up position and then you start your bike. The bike is started, your clutch is in, you take your left leg and you press down on the gear shift. The bike should be in neutral start and then you push one down for it to go into first gear and then all the rest. The gear order is first neutrals kind of in the middle and then second through 6 if you have this excuse. Um if you only have 5, that's kind of how most by skill. So clutch in, push your gear shifter down to 1st gear and then you slowly let out the clutch. The clutch has what we call it friction zone. In the friction zone is when the clutch starts to clamp on the rear tire and it starts to pull the bike. So you want to kind of feather the clutch in and out until you get comfortable with the friction zone and just understanding that it pulls the bike, how it feels, where it is, everything like that. Once the clutch is all the way out, the bike is rolling in, your moving and then your right hand is the throttle, the throttle takes you further it. It's like your gas pedal in a car, um from their throttle, clutch in, shift up, clutch out and throw out the same time. So this is the type of motion you doing here, doing throttle and clutch out and then you have your front brake with your right hand, your rear brake with your left. Bread safe.",6.0
"Hello, my name is Carrie Screen. In a previous position I held with IBM, I was an HR Co-op intern. What that means is we working. Actually, I was with Mariana, who's in this group with me right now. We worked, it worked in HR. We did a lot of auditing. Um, we were apart of a transitional phase from IBM to Kindle. So if you were in IBM employee and now you're a Kindle employee, one of us probably helped. You move along in that process we we ordered you and look at your documents and made you a Kindle employee. In that position. The on boarding process can get a little bit sticky. It's a little bit difficult, especially if you've never done it before. So our role as interns, we were assigned to create videos to try to make the on boarding process easier. Um, it was me and three other two other interns, three of us total, and we designed these videos. We we screen recorded us going through the on boarding process and we made these educational videos for people to be able to watch and follow to make the on boarding process a little bit easier because what was happening is people would. They would go through the onboarding process and then they would do it wrong and then we would have to go back and correct it. So it made it a whole other layer of work to have to go back, undo and then re onboard them correctly. So that project was a lot of fun to get to do and actually do something that was helpful and beneficial to IBM. And getting to work with other interns was was great as well. My team was awesome and we were able to meet the deadline on time and make some pretty fun videos. I don't know, I think that they're cute and I think that they're educational and they're, you know, they're not boring and but they're also precise and to the point and full of great content.",5.0

"An issue that I think that the world should be paying more attention to is motorcycle safety. If you haven't caught adrift in all my videos, I'm very into motorcycles. That's what I'm passionate about. That's what I enjoy doing with my hobby. Um, is it the most pressing, world changing idea? No, not at all. Should we probably be focusing more on the environmental issues? Yes, but this is an issue that's close to my heart and it's what I can talk about. Motorcycle safety. I. Firmly believe that. Helmet laws should. Bi laws in all states. Here in Colorado where I live, there is no motorcycle helmet law. You can ride without a helmet. Um, I think that's crazy. I think that you are a danger to yourself and others if you don't wear a helmet. Um especially if you let others on the back of your bike with helmet without helmet. Excuse me um. Also, we don't have a whole lot of motorcyclists in the states, not compared to other countries. So that leads to cars being. Blinded by us, we they don't see us. We ride like we're invisible because cars aren't. They don't see us lots of times. So I believe that in um driving courses there should be a special like motorcycle section. I think that motorcycles should be in more mainstream media. I think it should just be more common knowledge that there are motorcycles out there and you have to watch them. You have to look for them. Because while motorcycle accidents with lots of the times argument cycles fault lots of times, they aren't the most common. Motorcycle death is when. There is a car turning left and the motorcycle going straight and the car just turns right into the motorcycle and there's just nothing you can do as the motorcyclist to protect yourself. So as a motorcyclist, be smart, wear gear, be safe as a car driver, use your blinker, it's really important and check your mirrors for motorcyclists.",5.0

Women were actually valued in Athens culture and that's why we own 40% of the land, which is it was just phenomenal. Um, women were property, they were bought, sold and trade. Marriage was often the transactional. Thing. It was a transactional dispute between two people, so to have the knowledge that over 40% of the land was owned by women is pretty phenomenal.",4.0

Well, now IBM functions mainly in the hybrid cloud. You know what happens when you upload your picture to the cloud and then you don't have to have it on your hardware anymore. That's us. We have big old rooms full of computers where we store information. Hybrid, hybrid, public and private cloud are all industries that IBM partakes in. That is our main money maker, the cloud. Eh di? Lies. Again, I'm also like slide people. We were told that this would be a 60 minute presentation, but no, it's 80. What else is IBM? Do IBM also funds the P tech program? The P tech program is where we educate young individuals and then tell them that we're going to give them jobs.

But if you talk to anybody who's worked at IBM, most of the people who I've worked with and IBM aren't even into computers. So it just shows how broad. Of the how broad the company is and how many different things they do. So some people say that you need to know the basics for a computer, how to use computer, how to write a document, sent an e-mail, but that's about it.

I think if we ought to try to look for more, ah, good things in people instead of trying to bring them down, we just think of the most parts about social media. It's cancel culture. It's trying to wind up with somebody, did his race, young people, and it's just. Weird to me.

Is Punta dribble left or right? It would hit the square button which would be on the side right here to shoot X button which would be down here to pass.

"Alright, today I'm gonna teach you guys how to do a. Brake pads on your car. Last time I did the engine. Today I'ma do the brake pads. So to do the brake pads in the car you have to start by. To do the front, those are probably more hard. To do the back flip the front, you take the wheel off. And then there's usually like. You gotta help get tools where you go, like. Some sockets or ranch? And then? That should be some brake cleaner. You need that code. It gets really messy. And probably if you're doing like you're ugly, you need like a pan to put in the bottom so you don't get the driveway dirty. And if you want gloves, well, that's good too. And then you start by taking the wheel off. And then I know you break the boards off the nuts loose, and then you. Check the car, the car up and then after that you. Have to take the wheel off, take their nuts off, take the wheel off and then you'll find yourself. Usually most of the cars have like 2 bolts that hold the. Brake caliper. And then you just take those off and then they break. Helper should come loose. And then after that big, just pull out the two brake pads. There's one on each side of the front, the back and then. Just put those, grease them up, put them back, put the brake caliper back on. And then the votes, and that's what you do for the front ones and then for the back ones kind of thing, you Jack up the back and then. Take the wheeled off and sometimes a little easier 'cause they're usually smaller, they breaks, so you just do. It's probably 2 bowls the same and for the cars and then recording in progress. Dog brake pads and they got drum brakes daughter a lot harder because. You gotta pop it open. Most of the time they're hardstuck. But yeah, that's how you do a brake pad in the car.",3.0

We all had different times when like how the Dr thru when and how fast people went there and came out so. We that was one of our priorities there, that we had to keep the times loafer, that people just came or did. Peyton got their food and left. They didn't have to wait. The thing that will McDonald's like Dent, if you were the top floor, they would give you. Like bonuses to all the workers. And the thing that we did have a heart like team, we created like a strategy to. Like make those times below are So what we did was that. There was two people back into cashier. One taking orders and then the other one taking the money. In the first window and then the second window was just one person handing out the drinks and then the food, and then we had other people. Um, getting the special drinks like the ones that are made by the soda machine, like the coffees and stuff like that. And then the kitchen people, they they're pretty much really fast, so they just move. And. Yeah, and that's how we came up with tragedy indeed. Appreciate we did get first place in the storing some of them. Sometimes it was hard 'cause smarter time. People like McDonald's, they get rushes, lot of people go and they get it backs up so. But most of the time we did keep that. I'm very low.",4.0
"So. Well, we did in McDonald's was we had to have our time slow. That's what they were focused on. They had times in every different store to the drive through for that. People just went in and out. They didn't have to wait that long. And we had times there to feed store was about like in first place they had like places like first place, second place, third place I think there was five. The five was obviously the lowest and. Yes, we came over the strategies to how to make it fast and. And then the day we did, our strategy worked. It was basically just to have two people in the bag in the first window and then. Three, delete doing the drinks. And then the kitchen will doubts. They move pretty quick 'cause there's a lot of people back then and our strategy ended up working and we ended up getting like first place. Most of the time 'cause it worked.",
"Something that the world should start like looking more into and probably be like, I would say gas. And energy because. We need both of those things a lot, and. They're like running out, I guess. So like gas he's running out and then. Electricity we could like. Do it like with windmills or like the water will go. Like those dams that run water like that and then. Well, I feel like they should focus more on that because. Dance central that we need and. Soon there will be no more gas, and that's how we get, uh, get around. I mean, yeah, they have electric cars, but there, most of them are expensive in my room, can afford them. They're like. 506070 K. So. In the future, like they should make cars that are. Either use I think cars are use um. This type of gas is a different type of gas like hydrogen I think. I don't know. And then. That's one option and then I guess electric, but they'll be cheaper. And then for electricity they could do the windmills or windmills. Or more. The arms. Because we are running out of that also, but. Appreciate what else can they do about electricity, could probably do like. Um. I would just Add all once I could think of this windmills and the dams. Just use our resources, the water and wind.

"The key part of my manager plan for the year is to really work with my direct reports for Betterment for themselves, but also to help our department, um, I think with the client work we do, that can be very fickle. Sometimes things change, priority changes, priorities change. So it's difficult to try to align on KPIs or deliverables at the onset of a year for direct reports when so much can be up in the air as the year goes on. What I want to focus on is helping. My direct reports obtained certifications in training that can tie back directly to client work, but also just increased their knowledge set and eventually promote them out of being a direct report of mine. I see that kind of turnover, whether it's promoted to my level or moving into a different role if they find that things are not a good fit for them is the. Is a key benchmark for success for any department, um. As part of this, my strategies for the year again are to increase certification rate among directs. Report Direct reports helped spread the allocation of direct reports across multiple clients in order to give them more of a knowledge base and skill set and just keep their interest level high and then again increase that urgency to promote out of direct reports. In order to do this, we're going to have. Training checkins. Every other week during our one on ones at the start of the year. I want them to spend time aligning on a training and certification program that fits what they want to do with their career and also matches with client work. Some of the blockers are going to be timing to dedicate to learning. However, if we can align programs with clients that is billable work, I believe that that should limit any issue with allocation. We are going to have quarterly presentations on the learnings and opportunities that they're finding. Again, everything that they learned should be tide back to something that they see with the client. For instance, if they're on Adobe client and they're going through a EMM certification finding opportunities through that training that. They can apply to a client, would be a valuable learning and presentation and help them turn training into a clear cut. Client deliverables at the end of the year that KPIs or we're going to have monthly learning share outs in lieu of 1 on one. So I want them to teach me what they're learning at a high level and so they can position themselves as the expert and also get familiarity with presenting to a client with opportunities like this at the end of the year. We want them to have one client or individual LED training certification completed. There should be some sort of finality to that training at the end of the year and hopefully this is more of a personal KP. I don't know if it's possible, but I would like a 25% direct report turn over again through either each year again through either. Uhhh promotions or they find a role that they are better suited for based on what they learned throughout the year.",5.0
"My management philosophy has grown over the last eight weeks and now I want to be a manager that's known for direct feedback after developing an atmosphere of trust and transparency. I want my direct report to be able to comfortably come to me with their problems, whether that's at the workplace with a client with the deliverable. But instead of jumping right into solution ING with them, I want to be known for giving guided direction through the DOC. Approach, I want to make sure that they know that at the end of the day it is up to me to hold them accountable, but it's up to them to solve their problems. I think that is a key differentiator. Differentiator that I need to focus on is again providing that direct feedback, but after developing that atmosphere of trust, trust and empathy to make my direct reports OK with opening up to me.",6.0
"Hey, Joanna Global could be today. I just wanted to give you an update on how my individual reports and my team is performing and the growth um seeing in them. Um definitely the star of the bunch is Colleen. She is a proactive go getter. She's very open and honest about the issues that she has with clients or with work and she's very good at problem solving but also being collaborative with that problem solving. The sky is the limit in terms of potential. She should be in a department leadership. In the next three to five years. At VML Y&R um, Next up we have Lana Richie. She is a problem solver and she is kind of more under the radar. Some of the difficulties that she deals with our lack of desire and a lack of maybe professional professionalism to go in front of the clients. Part of that though is, OK, she's an individual contributor. We just need to make sure that she can understand the bigger picture to deliver the process goals that we need with content management to keep the ship. Running um, we have Billy Karanja up next. He's a new direct report for me, but from everything I've seen, he's per active. He is definitely motivated. I think some of the things that he's struggling with though, I think it's unclear where he wants to go in his career. He's trying to do a lot and I think it's difficult for him to hone in on how to develop fully when he doesn't know where he wants to go just yet. Finally, we have Adam Rodenberger. Um, I think that one of the issues with Adam is he lacks self-awareness to see the. Issues he's struggling with. Um, he doesn't have great attention to detail and he over complicates things because of that because he gets so far down one path, but he missed a key detail. I don't know if this is the right role for him, but he's definitely a. He definitely wants to learn, but we need to help him develop that self-awareness to realize the mistakes he's making at the time he's making them, as opposed to too far down the line.",

"Hi Joanna, I need to have a difficult conversation with you. Is now a good time? Fantastic. As you know, a few months ago we discussed a performance improvement provement plan for Bob. We knew at the time that he was underperforming and that he was struggling with some work life balance issues that was leading to less than stellar results for our clients. In terms of his deliverables, um, we did see improvement with Bob in the coming weeks. After that it seemed like it really lit a fire under him. However, the further we have got away from. When we installed that Pip, um, his work has suffered and it seems like Bob is really struggling with taking personal accountability for what he delivers at work. I think at this point I need to recommend that we let him go. I do not think this is the right team or the right opportunity for him. Quite honestly, my biggest concern is a lack of personal accountability. Again, when we installed the PIP, he was very motivated. And he asked for weekly Checkins and we gave him those updates knowing that that's not. Maintainable, not sustainable forever. Um, as we gave him more more freedom to ensure that that performance improved, he has dropped his performance. Um, it seems like he needs that ownership, excuse me. That visibility and that that oversight from leadership to make sure his work is delivered in his role. We can't have somebody holding his hand all the time. I don't think this is the right opportunity for him. And because of that. I think was time to let him go. In summary, again, we saw improvement, but Bob just needs more oversight than we can give him, and we need to let him go and find somebody that's more suited to work autonomously.",6.0

A part of a larger thing and she has accepted by the team. We all get along socially. Maddie just has something she needs to work on. I'm not too concerned. I know she has an inner to get him done.

And talk to Jenn, your boss, and make sure that she's aware of everything that's going on, on the team as a whole within her department. And also to demonstrate that you're in the know that you also have your finger on the pulse about what's going on. So I think overall our teams are doing great. Um Bailey, of course, is a Rockstar. She leads as a supervisor. Leeds everybody day today to get things done. Bryce is growing. Sam's new to the account, new to advertising in general and he's picking things up. Um think there is one trouble spot that would be be Maddie area that we're concerned about. Um I think most importantly let me preface this first that the intangible she has she the most important things in my opinion are getting along with the team having synergy with them. Being. A part of a larger thing and she has accepted by the team. We all get along socially. Maddie just has something she needs to work on. I'm not too concerned. I know she has an inner to get him done. She just needs to slow down. She needs to focus and she needs to just gain confidence, which will come with repetition, which Bailey and are working on her with Jim proof and Integreon strengthen UM and I like I said, I do think that um what she has in his good at is. Invaluable because having some, uh, this **** *** at their job, but their team cancer is the worst thing you could have. I would rather have somebody that gets along with the team and everybody loves them and is in embrace them and just has areas to improve, which is what we're doing with Maddie. Clients are happy.",
"So our department bosses, Chrissy Neely, she's her official job titles managing director UM. And she's honestly she's a great boss um. She operates I think the right way with um managing her directors that all were underneath her report directly to her in that she has faith and trust in us to do our jobs. She doesn't micromanage, but she's actively involved and engaged if needed when we bring her in. Um, she really only asked that we keep her in the loop, that we elevate any problems, concerns just so she can address them before they've obviously get get larger. Um and she just has trust in us, which is great. Um, I think her KP eyes are the three dominant ones or predominant ones that I can identify are running a successful and happy department. She's more focused internally on the back end with admin. Um subscriptions relationships that we use to make our clients happy and successful. So she does a really good job at that. So keeping it successful and happy department. She does activities to make sure everybody is engaged and having a good time. She keeps agency clients happy with connections and she improves on areas within the department like I mentioned before, admin areas that need to be improved, how I could help her achieve her goals, greater communication or what my team has been doing, successes and areas to improve. And also to take on more admin department relationship, leadership tasks proactively just to help her out. Also to position myself to grow as well.",
"Hi Susie, ER member 5 minutes from you. Thanks, um. So unfortunately, we're going to have to let you go, um. And. This is difficult for us to do. Um, hopefully it doesn't come as a complete surprise because as you know, we've had discussions over the past three months about deficiencies in your work, areas for improvement and we've had weekly checkins and clearly defined goals that have to be achieved on a weekly and monthly basis in order for you to. Continued improve. And as we've gone through that and had our weekly discussions, it's become pretty apparent that unfortunately it does not look like this is something that you will be able to successfully achieve. And it's probably in our best interest, in your best interest if we move, if we separate, go our separate ways and move forward. In another way, um, I just want you to know that we've really enjoyed having you on the team. I've personally learned a lot and had great time working with you. So is everybody else on the team, and we wish you nothing but the best and success in your future endeavors.

"Alright, so in order to win this competition, here's what we're going to do. There are five main parts of this table and everybody is going to own one part. The instruction manual listed out according to the parts what needs to be done and in what order. So I'm going to divide that up. I'm going to rip the paper up. You're going to have that instruction portion for your part that starts first, second, third, 4th. And what we're going to do is we're all going to. Working order and do our part and assemble it in the most efficient and quickest way possible. So you go first, you go second, you go third, you go forth.",7.0
"Hey team. So here's the deal. Don't worry about anybody else that we're competing with. We're going to give you the one key. The one key item that we need to do as a team to build this IKEA desk and that is follow the instructions and the instructions might be a little complicated, but take your time with EMM. Read the visuals on the. On the IKEA instructions and just make sure you go one by one and make sure that you check off on each one is really easy with IKEA instructions to. Move a little too fast and put a piece in the wrong place. Or maybe not include a thing, but if you pay attention closely, it will guide you in the way that you need to go. So take your time, read the instructions and let's go. Have fun. Thanks.",6.0
"The employee that we talked about a few months ago that we put on a performance plan, um, after an initial kind of burst of um kind of performing better in being in the spot where they needed to be as falling back into kind of old habits, um. That they were that contribute signed their underperformance before. After some more conversations with this person, um, I'm feeling that it's time that we move on as an organization from. From employing them, which is really tough, I know that we we like this person and it's a situation that we not is not optimal or ideal but. The current contributions to the team and then historically what we've seen with this person. Will reflect the values that we have as a team and as as an organization. So at this time, I strongly recommend that we let this person go. Perhaps we look for opportunities to. Take care of them as we. As we let them go either through severance or help outside the organization. But at this time I strongly recommend that, um, we let this person go, so it's too bad. And we would like to um. Move forward in a positive way for the broader team and help them get in a spot where they can as a team perform better than they are currently. So thank you, hope you take care my recommendation and will talk further.",4.0
"So my boss is at the executive director level within my organization. Uhhh. I do not work directly on her team, um, and with her projects. So I sit on another line of business. I've worked with her in the past, but it's it's been a long time since we've worked directly together. Honestly, it actually worked out really well. She has a line of sight into the organization and our. Kind of department, if you will, in a way that I don't have so she can be my eyes and ears, that kind of a larger organizational level. Um. And I'm also able to kind of do that for her on the project and team that I'm on. So it actually works out really well. I think the only hiccup is that she's not in my day today or even close to it. So there's dynamics of like my current team both above me and below me that she doesn't understand everyday, but otherwise pretty good.",
"So right now my team is doing fantastic. They've adopted to um new client, a new brand, a new overall team within the organization and they've jumped in really with both feet and um have honestly excelled and provided a ton of value pretty much from day one. I've been keeping in really close contact that we as we've made this transition with my team members. Checking in on them, making sure that they have what they need. What questions do they have and how can I help them? Removing roadblocks, finding out information, whatever it may be to help them kind of with their day-to-day and their day-to-day, that helps me with the overall team as well. So right now, everybody's just doing really well and I'm proud of how they've transitioned into these new rules. The other thing is we're looking for those kind of future opportunities within this team. So we've got a project in front of us for the next few. Months. But um, what is after that that our team is going to dive into here and there? So not only just managing, are we managing like the day today and kind of the near future, but also just kind of having conversations about like what other opportunities would you like to have within this larger team that are going to help you with your career and the things that you want to do within this organization. So overall, really well right now and I'm really proud of him.",
"My philosophy, I think. In a nutshell, is to be an enabler for folks that I manage. Um, either directly within a team and that can take. Shape in many different ways, and I think 1 as a direct report, I want to be there for somebody that wants to grow their career, be successful, take advantage of opportunities that are within the organization and see if they can be the best person they can within the workplace, organization, team, etc. And then from a team standpoint, also be that person that can be a mentor to folks at times, but also be somebody that. Helps unlock opportunities and even, you know, hopefully can remove roadblocks. Roadblocks from not only like a personal standpoint but also a management standpoint as well. So overall I hope to be an enabler for my teams.",4.0
"So I have two teams really. So I have a team that is my direct report, which is one person. And then I have a project team, which at times is actually different project teams, um, sometimes my direct report is on the team, other times that person is not. So for my direct report actually going to continue doing a lot of things that we have been doing for quite awhile as yours in fact, to make sure that we have good trust. With one another and that we are continuing our path of growth for like for both of us really not only is like a team but as individuals. So we will continue with regular checkins helping with that trust component open. Open policy for. Any issues, hopes, dreams, opportunities, you know things that may come up that my direct report would like to talk about or take advantage of. Um many different ways. And then always I'm always keeping a lookout or and I forward on growth opportunities for that person as well. Making sure that they're aligned with those types of opportunities, but also seeing things that they can't see sometimes just given the hierarchy at ah within the organization, so within. Um, project team um. The opportunities and plan is a little bit different. One, we're obviously moving towards the end of uh. We're moving towards a project and project goal and many of the folks that are on the team are not my direct reports and also might not even be. The folks that are within my same discipline. So I'll be working with folks that are in other disciplines that pull together that make the team for the project. So a lot of my efforts around that is, eh, establishing trust with that team from day one and continuing that all the way through being very clear about deadlines, expectations and then also being flexible within the project as things come up from either clients, things that are. Don't necessarily go as planned during the project, but also listening to my team on pulling in their expertise and their knowledge to affect ultimately what we do within the project. So being flexible within that, those are kind of I felt like a key recipe into making a pretty good project and not being overly authoritarian or. You know, kind of um. Stubborn if you will, about how a project should go, but really like laying out at least an initial plan and taking it from there through the end. So with that two different project plans for kind of two different scenarios. Thank you.",4.0
"OK, my plan for my team, um. The plan for my project teams both have project teams and direct reports that are not on project teams um list at the key steps we need to achieve slash accomplish um and applied dates to them. And he's. Backup and then. Applied to specific. Um, goals, tasks, deadlines. We need to make for these. Specific timelines, work streams, um. Some of the dates can move, of course, but at least they give us something to work towards or work against. Um. For the four my project sheets for the for these teams, I've added KPIs to each of these goals or subtasks so the team constantly has a Y at top of mind, as do doing what we're doing. Um, again, these are for my project teams. Not really my direct reports I've asked. Um. During my one on ones leading up to annual assessments for direct reports, I've been sharing out some of the hike sessions discussions. Um. And. I've been talking to them about goals and KPIs. Um, not just the annual. The annual goal, but to. Put a calendar to it on a monthly basis or at least something that's more than just a quarterly check in. So they have kind of specific. Specific tasks they need to achieve each step of the way, and it's not a middle of the year. I haven't done anything for my goal yet. Um. I think this is important and I my one of my next steps as I need to update my self-assessment and do the same um. Then break it out into. Actual more detailed plan. I was asked by director reports to think of goals that are challenging but attainable and that have both professional and individual, even personal, impact. As I believe this actually does affect the quality of work and the quality of employee happiness. And therefore client happiness. Um. I think I just made sense. I hope I did. Thank you. It's been fun.",4.0
"OK, um. Major philosophy. So I've always been good at working with conflict. Um had not necessarily seen it as sorry, hang on, life cameras. Phone down here. Um. Have not always seen it as simple as energy, so I'd say this course is affected on how I work with conflict. Not just always trying to dissolve it or clear the air, but potentially um. Depending on the direct report or the team member in a team that I'm managing potentially steer them towards conflict towards resolved in a positive way. My overall philosophy of I don't have managed hasn't changed. It's possible. Transparency in shared success still there, everybody seemed, or um, now turning to your picture. I'm really doing good.

We can divide up and conquer as quickly as possible. I'm going to assume legs and drawers are the two main. Items. So we're going to say if that's the case, one and two, you guys get the legs, you can feel free to tear up, tear the instruction booklet um paged out as we need to see fit. #3 and me will get the drawers. Before we move on #1, while you have the instructions, let's go through the inventory to make sure that we have all the key pieces. And once we do, we'll start to sit down this path, um, once we get the legs and drawers setup, would she rechecked the instructions? Of course, but assuming that we all end back on the glass top table and work that together to finish it out as ah.",5.0
"Hey, I'd like to have a brief discussion with you about James, but we do that, um. James is good energy and has always brought a certain. Biki spirits the team which I know you appreciate and I always appreciate as well, but. Recently it's just and I've read with him on multiple times to discuss this over the past. Three months, once a month. We've met his qualities gone quite down. He's not checking his work. Um, he's not submitting the tickets in on a timely manner. He joined up working as a function of the team and as someone who's actually helping to get things solved for the project. It's very much that he is kind of working on a silo. Not sure what's going on. I did meet with him to try to find out if there was anything. Um. Circumstantial in his in his life, it was, you know, external to this work. Um. However, under each meeting review we've discussed their season. It's really about his energy here and. We need to. I believe the training window or the upswing window has. Has ended and we need to actually replace him, so. Well, I know that you really like him and support him and. But overall for the team, this is not working out. So um. There's my case. I think you know what I want to do. I'd like to give him notice within the next couple days and you know, I want to talk to you about if he stays on throughout the end of that week or if they would give him two weeks notice or end on that day.

"My boss is the Managing director of what apartment North America. That's her title. I would say in effect, she's more than that. She's actually more right under the client engagement lead for North America. Um, especially since our teams have joined, our departments have joined client engagement and delivery solutions. Um. I would say the. She's also works as on certain accounts really as a team lead, so. That's an interesting role 'cause it time. Sometimes, even though we're delivery, I believe that we play. Interactive or digital? Um. Engagement account leads, and she does that for one rather large client across North America and globally. So it's an interesting role. Lot of work, great person. Um. Amount of time. Um.",
"OK, so. We've got 2 minutes coffee with the boss um. So team makeup, overall energy is really good. Um, communication is good. We've got some skills that we need to right size and balance out. Um. Somewhere between somebody being extremely technical but not being available. Um. One person analyst who's not quite as tactical as I believe she needs to be, that could actually be, um, countered. By. Adding more time for the tech lead or by actually. Potentially getting the program manager to own a little bit more of that because I know that he comes from a technical background. Overall roaming the right steps. Um. One person PM does tend to ramble in front of the clients. Like I'm rambling right now in front of the TV camera, this camera, but um. I mean all these things could all, everything is coachable except for the technical expertise. So we need to right size that on the team. And I believe that's unless we can find more of the tech leads time which will right now it's not the budget and even if it was, it's difficult to hold of him. So I need another him or I need more of his time and I think that will actually. Kind of mentally, right? Size the team more than anything else. I hope this makes sense. Also, I have covered. That's why I'm at home. OK, goodbye.",
"So as the director of the mobile app and Emerging tech team, there are really three key strategies I want to employ this year for the team. So one, I really want to have regular syncs with other client teams to confirm the satisfaction and growth opportunities among current clients in order to increase our billable and are billable rate and revenue among each client. Second, I want to build repeatable processes and. Templates within the work so that we can be more efficient. And three, I want us to be the go to subject matter experts throughout the organization on this topic. So the way that we're going to measure these is 1 we're going to retain or expand our existing scope among current clients. Second, we're going to increase our client deliverables and outputs by 20% by having more repeatable processes and templates in place. And 3rd everybody is going to put together. One piece of practice content per quarter that helps further identify us as the subject matter experts in this particular practice. The first KPI I want to hit is meeting with all of the client engagement executives among the current clients that we're working with to understand current client satisfaction and furthermore where their growth opportunities. And the second process KPI is that I want to increase our deliverables, outputs and artifacts among clients that we have templates, repeatable processes, but also we can showcase to the client what we've been delivering on paper. The 5% improvement ideas that I want to help us get to these goals faster would be creating a shared drive on one drive so that we can access each others templates and repeatable processes more easy, more easily. And then I also want to get a new tool called apptopia that can help us with competitive analysis and doing some client mapping and understanding where some opportunities are within clients. The last thing I want to do is really. Get started. And so for the next month, I really want to focus on sharing this plan with the team. And then in the next month and the month of December, I'm going to go ahead and create that shared drive on teams. I'm going to help one team member with a specific project and playbook that he has for a deliverables. So I want to make sure that's buttoned up for the client. And then secondly, we have a new team member switching client. So I want to make sure she gets up and running and we're starting to identify where the opportunities are for that client.",6.0
"My management philosophy really is defined by three key areas. So the first is really understanding my team as people and who they are. So I really want to understand what their strengths are, what they like working on, what they don't like working on. And so then we can really identify where we can help them thrive and where they may want more coaching and where they want less coaching. And I really want to meet them where they are and not expect them to all be at the same level. And have the same strengths, but really see them as individuals. The second philosophy I really want to have is them feeling emotional safety, so I know that they're going to excel in their jobs when they feel emotionally safe at work and don't feel like they're in a hostile working environment. And 3rd is really about honesty. So I want them to know that I'm always going to be honest with them and transparent about where their work is at and where the company is at.",6.0
"So as you know, we have three people on the team I really look at. Brooklyn and Julia Bing are superstars and Trevor is a rock star who just needs a little bit more coaching. So Trevor has a great attitude, great collaboration skills. He comes from working in apps, um, but I still want to work with him on mastering the basics of life cycle and continuing to help him work on his presentation skills. So he really wants to stay in the mobile app space and be a better strategist, not just task oriented. So what I want to do is work with him on strategy. So I want to be a little bit closer to his work and help him understand the storytelling of his work and his presentation skills so that he can help guide the client through that strategy. One other way I want to do that is have him meet with other people on the team to share work and what they're working on. For Juliet, Julia is really a rock star. She is great at building relationships across clients and kind of navigating the political waters within clients and has a really strong background in mobile. So I never worry about her kind of having the fundamentals down. So I think for her, it's just finding the right opportunities for that personal branding and professional growth and continuing to have her put together deliverables that is establishing that mobile program within the clients. And then third with Brooklyn, Brooklyn is a sharpshooter. She, you know, is a master of tools and process. And so I really want to get her, um, the right opportunities within clients where we're doing a tool implementation so that she can be alongside somebody with that and start to build a repeatable process off of that. Um. And so that would be the summary of our team.",
"My boss is Adam and Adam as a group director of mobile apps. Until he really overseas, 2 key pillars within the app. Practice, one of which is my pillar. So he overseas sort of the product owners and designers and developers with the creation of the mobile apps and then also overseas the app lifecycle practice. And so as part of his job he make sure that we are all billable within our clients and he can help with resourcing and moving people around in order to stay above 85% bill ability on clients. And so if we lose a client, it's part of his role to make sure that he finds a home for people within client. Work and then secondly, he can find new client opportunities, so bringing in new business to the practice and three, he really make sure that we have the tools we need to do our jobs effectively.",

Unfortunately, he has been underperforming and missing deadlines. I've talked to him about other things that could be going on in his life, and it doesn't seem like there are external factors contributing to this. And so I think we really need to have a serious conversation about their future role within the company. You know, his performance really needs to be here and he's been consistently here. We've tried to get him here or here and it's just not working out. I know you really like him and you've been rooting for him. But after the recent performance improvement plan, I haven't seen anything change and really think it's time for us to move on.

Two people should work on building the four legs so each person builds 2 legs. Sarah and Joe, since you guys collaborate together a lot and worked together a lot, I want the two of you to work on the column of drawers because since that will take a lot of strong teamwork. So you guys do that. Me and the other person will build the legs and let's come together at the end and we'll put the glass top on together to wrap it all up. So let's summarize. Me and the other person will work each to build 2 legs. Joe and Sarah will build the column of drawers, and then we'll all put the glass hub together at the end. Ready. Go.",6.0
"Alright, so the plan for my team is to build out a center of excellence for community managers in social strategists. So, so much of what we do from a social standpoint requires to be quick to develop processes and like essentially guardrails of where we can jump in. So building that out, empowering the top performing community managers that we have to bring their best practices forward to kind of align this as a team and set some standardization and develop a curriculum and rules of the road that can be adopted by the larger team. The first step we would do is meet up, have a knowledge share to see what's working and what's not working for other people. Some of the blockers that we have, our clients and scopes, sometimes we don't have everything that we need to make that happen, but um, we can do the best we can with in there for our improvement ideas we would. Be creating a teams channel for just First off. For the select community managers that so we can have a better view of everything that's happening in real time. From there we can start to develop a process for us to also internally boost other brands that we work for and develop those best practices for organizationally including those conversation benchmarks across across the board. So the KP eyes that we have for our team is really a lot of hard metrics, 5% increase in REACH and brand love sentiment and the number of conversations that we get in. So from looking at it from a year standpoint that we would start off in January. So we've assembled our team of high performing community managers with the ability to participate in those real time conversations and begin meeting through that month in the next on a biweekly basis to assess the landscape, what's happening, what things work for us will seek to combine our own individual best practices into a document that community managers can then receive when they start. And that's something that we can build that into Playbooks as well. Get the process approved for prime time in April, um. So make sure that everything that we bring together and the curriculum wise approved internally so we could start rolling this out. And then for the next two months we just run it and see how it goes. And then in July we will revisit the process and see how it's been working for people and look to see if we can optimize this in any certain way. August, we review team measurement to see how we can continue to improve, continue running in September as well. Jumping into October will review team measurement to see how we can continue to improve. So it's really just kind of taking a look at how we can optimize through the rest of the year, continue to run November based on those October optimizations and then revisit the whole plan again at the end of December to see how we tracked.",5.0
"My management philosophy is a lot of asking questions, you know, finding out where exactly they want to be. Um having? The perspective to reply to them, to let them know, you know, you know certain things that I found to be helpful. But I do like to have my teammates, um, personally. Try things out. Um, ask some questions, but really kind of try to own, own things and try to figure them out, because it's really where I found that people tend to grow the most by actually trying and working it out in their mind without needing to have their handheld the whole way for some issue situations that are very new. I'm happy to set an example and kind of show how we go forward, but ideally I like it when I can review what my team does and offer feedback so they can improve.",6.0

You know, making, making feedback, you know leaving feedback, making updates. She's doesn't wait to be asked to do things, which is great and does a great job managing up. Um, she's definitely on the track to be promoted to the next level for sure. Um, she's very strategic. Um needs very minimal feedback as well. So she's already growing in all the right ways and it's really just kind of helping her shepherd that. Um would love to see her work on some like larger full strategy social strategy campaigns, 'cause I feel like she's on the level 2 to progress to that. She's very online, so she also knows tremendously about what, like what's happening out. In the world so. Especially when talking to clients like she's a very knowledgeable person that I would trust to share anything. And Zach he is. The so hungry. He is a Rockstar that operates well above his level. He's always eager to jump into things. He wants to do the best he absolutely can. He will help anyone out. Um needs very little supervision, really has uh, management mindset. I think right now one thing with Zach that I want to temper is that he.

And I know that you all are very close, but in terms of how we're operating as a team, we need someone that is going to. Be able to manage this workload, um. What happens is we have to pull other people to do this, which makes their other to help out, and that makes what they normally do suffer because they're having to extend themselves into an area that they should not have to be. Doing as much and I think given. How we walked through the PIP. Set very clear expectations of how we needed to improve, where, when and how. And the fact that we're back in this again tells me that. It's not enough of a priority for her to improve to meet the. Standards that we have set as a team and I think I would recommend that we move forward with letting her go.",6.0
"So to build this desk right, take a look at the whole set of instructions and then begin to look at where we can split duties. So some people can begin on some sections so we can begin. Make sure that like if we start on this one part that it leads into the next um, so we can have teams building out the drawers. Typically just getting the drawers built together is something that doesn't require the rest of it, while we get another people building the actual. The shell of all of it so we can put things together and making sure that the the legs are attached. And um. So we have everyone kind of working independently and finishing their pieces and bring it to the end where like the leader I guess, I mean this scenario could be directing how we put them all together to make sure that we get that and.

"So the main focus for the next year for the Connections Health Team, social team is really about how do we make the team an integral part of the overall. Company right now we are seeing as more of a um assistance and Nice to have and the reality is that that's not how the industry is moving and that's not how the world is changing. So our objective and are my plan for the year is really focused on education and um integrating ourselves into what needs to get done. So the first step that we're working on is building out a capabilities. Jack, um, that is a little bit more in the weeds than some of the capabilities decks that we have right now, but really speaks to the health practice and why social media is so important for health. Um and what are the things that we can do and how we can help them and really helping them see us as how they actually can engage with us. One step for that is that we're working with some of the teams that we've partnered with um very well so far and. Using them to help develop the case study from the perspective of a. Uh CE person or a production person who works in those roles to help them understand exactly what it is we can do that will help make their lives easier and the work better across the board. The second thing that we're doing to improve that is using the. Uhhh standardizing some of the processes for the teams, so including developing standardized scopes that can be used as a jumping off point to save time and energy when we're developing a new project. Um, for the teams so that we can. Save them time as well as save ourselves time and energy. And then obviously anything that we do is going to be able to be customized and tweaked to fit whatever actually needs to get done. But so that way it saves them, you know, time and energy. And I think honestly by doing that, we demonstrate some of the value that we add, um, while we're helping them scope. And then thirdly, we're going to be setting up for the next year starting in January. Mapping out what of our projects that we see is being relevant for eh fees for other awards so that we can start documenting them as early as possible rather than waiting until the system is uh. Getting towards the end, um. And so we can get those and have them ready.",5.0
"My management philosophy really focuses on being able to find and identify the. Best skill sets of each of the employees that I work with and giving them the tools and the room to. Grow and develop that into their area of expertise. I think having one of the big. Enablers of that is going to be having some, um, standardized documentation, um and some standardized kind of templates so that people aren't trying to spend their time working on the um things that are easily repeatable and instead they can spend their time thinking about how they can put their own flair and put their own spin on it. And I think as part of that, uh will enable me to be more hands off as well as them to grow.",6.0
"The focus on the team I think is in a really great place. We are really. Adding value to the projects that we're working on, I think as as you know, the biggest challenge is that those who aren't working with us, um, have a hard time understanding what exactly it is that we do and how we can be of value and honestly thinking ahead to how they can scope us into projects um, so. I think one of the biggest challenges and what we're working on developing is sort of the distinct health social capabilities because while we have um. Eh. Similar. Uh, focus too much of the social teams in the building. The reality is 99% of what the health practices doing right now is paid, and that is. So the focus that we have in kind of the, the global social practice as a whole on organic content, on developing content and um, live content is not really as relevant to them. So I think it's important that we provide that education and let them know about the capabilities. But I really want to help develop our social health capabilities to focus laser focus on what it is that they might actually be um. Be able to use us for in the next year or so as we and then use that kind of foot in the door to help push um beyond that to the new things that we can help with and I think that. We're in the process of getting that set up.",
"My boss drawn is the head of social connections for the New York office in UM at VML INR. He is largely responsible for ensuring that um, our team is getting uh, adding value and getting scoped into accounts, making sure that we're profitable, making sure that we are being. Uhhh asked to provide the right kinds of things. I think it's a little bit difficult and tricky for our team specifically because the. Efforts that most of the team is providing um is a little different from our practice. So I think the. What he's able to provide value on in the health practices a little bit more tricky because they aren't doing organic content.",
"So I know we've had a couple of conversations already about Zach and his performance. Um, I think we're all waiting to see what happens in the next um couple of weeks once he's back from his leave. I think the. Main um. Challenge and concern or the the decision I've come to is that I don't know that he has the gravitas and um, level of engagement that is necessary to be an associate director on this team. The reality is that. I have more junior employees who I can trust more without needing to handhold or babysit. Um and. That. Is a real challenge when his role was created, specifically to allow me to focus less on the day-to-day of specific projects and accounts so that I can focus on growing the team? Um, the. 1. Thought process or the one thought that I had was, um, potentially having a conversation with Jenn Kolanda. Conversation with him around whether knowing his background is really in media planning, knowing that that's an area that he does excel at, and I think he has an opportunity to provide value to the team in that way. If it would be worth having a conversation if that's an area that he's interested in continuing to grow. But if he is really committed or really stuck on doing social strategy, I think that's not going to be an area where we can, um, use. His work anymore?",5.0
"Alright team, the biggest thing that we um are gonna need to do to win this is really be organized and make sure that we are not um repeating work or we're not uh kind of stepping on each others toes. So what I want to do is we're going first thing we're gonna do is take all of the pieces, lay them out, make sure that we have an accurate count of all of the things that are supposed to be in the box and then we can break that up into the. Different pieces of the desk, we can identify which things can be made at the same time or which things can be need to be developed kind of in a waterfall process and then we can assign teams to that and kind of get going. I think the the main thing here is just make sure that we're being really careful to follow the instructions and that we are not um. Repeating ourselves.",5.0
"Alright, so the plan for my team is to build out a center of excellence for community managers in social strategists. So, so much of what we do from a social standpoint requires to be quick to develop processes and like essentially guardrails of where we can jump in. So building that out, empowering the top performing community managers that we have to bring their best practices forward to kind of align this as a team and set some standardization and develop a curriculum and rules of the road that can be adopted by the larger team. The first step we would do is meet up, have a knowledge share to see what's working and what's not working for other people. Some of the blockers that we have, our clients and scopes, sometimes we don't have everything that we need to make that happen, but um, we can do the best we can with in there for our improvement ideas we would. Be creating a teams channel for just First off. For the select community managers that so we can have a better view of everything that's happening in real time. From there we can start to develop a process for us to also internally boost other brands that we work for and develop those best practices for organizationally including those conversation benchmarks across across the board. So the KP eyes that we have for our team is really a lot of hard metrics, 5% increase in REACH and brand love sentiment and the number of conversations that we get in. So from looking at it from a year standpoint that we would start off in January. So we've assembled our team of high performing community managers with the ability to participate in those real time conversations and begin meeting through that month in the next on a biweekly basis to assess the landscape, what's happening, what things work for us will seek to combine our own individual best practices into a document that community managers can then receive when they start. And that's something that we can build that into Playbooks as well. Get the process approved for prime time in April, um. So make sure that everything that we bring together and the curriculum wise approved internally so we could start rolling this out. And then for the next two months we just run it and see how it goes. And then in July we will revisit the process and see how it's been working for people and look to see if we can optimize this in any certain way. August, we review team measurement to see how we can continue to improve, continue running in September as well. Jumping into October will review team measurement to see how we can continue to improve. So it's really just kind of taking a look at how we can optimize through the rest of the year, continue to run November based on those October optimizations and then revisit the whole plan again at the end of December to see how we tracked.",2.0
"My management philosophy is a lot of asking questions, you know, finding out where exactly they want to be. Um having? The perspective to reply to them, to let them know, you know, you know certain things that I found to be helpful. But I do like to have my teammates, um, personally. Try things out. Um, ask some questions, but really kind of try to own, own things and try to figure them out, because it's really where I found that people tend to grow the most by actually trying and working it out in their mind without needing to have their handheld the whole way for some issue situations that are very new. I'm happy to set an example and kind of show how we go forward, but ideally I like it when I can review what my team does and offer feedback so they can improve.",4.0
"So I've got two teammates. I've got Jackie Turner, who I've worked with for the past five or six months in some varying degrees on Coca-Cola business, but also now on Sam's Club. And what's great about her is that she has gotten a tremendous amount of initiative. Something happens and she's already jumped in. Um. You know, making, making feedback, you know leaving feedback, making updates. She's doesn't wait to be asked to do things, which is great and does a great job managing up. Um, she's definitely on the track to be promoted to the next level for sure. Um, she's very strategic. Um needs very minimal feedback as well. So she's already growing in all the right ways and it's really just kind of helping her shepherd that. Um would love to see her work on some like larger full strategy social strategy campaigns, 'cause I feel like she's on the level 2 to progress to that. She's very online, so she also knows tremendously about what, like what's happening out. In the world so. Especially when talking to clients like she's a very knowledgeable person that I would trust to share anything. And Zach he is. The so hungry. He is a Rockstar that operates well above his level. He's always eager to jump into things. He wants to do the best he absolutely can. He will help anyone out. Um needs very little supervision, really has uh, management mindset. I think right now one thing with Zach that I want to temper is that he. Needs to work a little bit more on his delegation because he has that ability to operate at that higher level but then keeps getting himself bogged down in. The day today, in a way where he could be, um, leading more and doing less.",
"Alright, so my boss Rachel um dats is newer. She took over the social team, probably at. You know, like four months ago. And. Really, she's been kind of setting like resetting the entire stage. Now we actually have a group of people that are in a shared office. So really it's kind of hitting a reset button on how we were operating as a team and actually promoting um. Camaraderie around a single office where we've been so splintered for awhile, so her KP eyes really are growing. Our strategic and creative abilities, um, establishing processes that we can do that we can create to train new employees and kick off clients, also retention. Ah, I help out a lot in the retention area. I've I've come to be sort of one of the people that has got in really well with our junior talent and able to talk to them in a way that validates them, answers the harder questions in a transparent way. I also heavily involved with leading and in coaching these junior talent, especially in that Tees up very nicely to the thought leadership that I've been developing like the. Community Management Center of Excellence that I've been talking about in here, as well as um. You know how to build out lots of strategies that we employ across a number of brands.",

"Hi there. I'd like to share with you my management plan. Our team is in a bit of flux, um, so I've developed one that's going to be a little more fluid and assessed every quarter. Um, first staff. Actually, the first three things I want to accomplish are getting the right people. I want to re energize re energize those people and then establish consistency. Um, getting back to the right people. Um getting the right people on the bus and recasting the talent as needed. Right now we've absorbed people from different teams. There's been layoffs, there's been shifts, people been placed in positions because they were essentially a warm body. So to say there maybe not the right people or the right talent for that role, I really want to dig in and understand what makes my direct reports tick. I want to set up those 45 minute meetings with them, really understand their goals professionally and personally and then identify. From there, the rock stars versus superstars um. Then I want to identify the superstars and start priming and focus on finding my number one and then my #2 um. There's definitely some people on the team that are. Are currently and could be great managers, and there's definitely some more of the rock stars that do their thing. They do it well, but they're just not in it and cut out to be a manager. Um, second, I want to go back. Um, I want to re energize 18 months. We get the right people on the bus and the right talent, so to say. Um, we've been working from home. A lot of them are not coming into the office. I want to at least set up some statuses. And get them excited about coming into the office, re energized the team, do some fun team outings and get them excited and invested in the work and then the output of that get that 5% stretch from them, have them enjoy and just say what can we get a little bit more I think having some in person. Activities and some in person accountability if you will, is going to help give us that stretch goal. Um and 3rd establish consistency. Right now things are siloed a bit across err 3 disciplines in the business which are paid, owned and eh calm, um, the outputs are different, we have different status, meetings are run differently, deliverables to clients are sent differently. It's just the consistency is not there. So really want to take an assessment, get the sub semi subject matter experts in to help assess and provide consistency, um, measurement in measuring all these is going to be hugely important. Real time feedback with the team checking in how they're doing, if they are being shifted into new positions, how are they doing and then will also measure, measure this by client feedback via surveys and then performance. Um. So in summary, I management plan is going to be fluid and it's going to shift or be reassessed every quarter, but I want to focus on getting first the right people, the right talent. I want to re energize the team and then three aiming to be an established consensus consistency. Across the team, thank you.",4.0
"Hi there for me management Landers my management philosophy ladders into three key topics. First is trust, second listening and 3rd is affective systems and or processes. Trust. You need to build it and protect it and protect um. Protect your team and the culture of the people on your team listening. You definitely learn more listening than you do by talking. So listening is very very important. Listen to your team. Um listen about what? Makes him tick. Understand both their goals, professionally and personally. Really, really unpack and understand and listen. Um, affective systems and or processes. Strong systems, strong results, week systems, weak results, right? We've learned that um gotta work collaboratively with your team to develop that process and or that system.

"Hi, Rebecca. Thanks so much for meeting with me um, over coffee today. I'm loving the face to FaceTime lately and just wanted to talk to you about the team. Um Kelly, as you know, is a complete superstar. Love her. She's great with our clients. She leads very, very little oversight or anything really that she needs for me other than just coaching and checking in. She definitely is someone I want to groom for my #1 and she could definitely start stepping into more of that director level. Um, Anna Rockstar, complete Rockstar. She does a great job with work. There's no um, no issues, nothing incorrect. She is a great repor with clients, but she's not a good manager. She really likes doing her own thing and and that's fine, we'll find a role for her on the team and there definitely is a place for her. But it's good to know that um that she definitely has. Her output is good, but as far as a manager, she is not quite there yet, nor do I think it's something that she wants. So going to continue to work with her on on goal setting and really map out. Where she wants to be in her future, Manuela. Um, she used to be, er, superstar, but her performance lately has been slipping based on for medical issues. She hasn't been feeling well. She is pregnant now, so just working with her on. Ways to overcome things that are triggering her sickness, migraines and things like that. So um, she is aware and she definitely wants to improve. So we're working on a plan of dividing and conquering and just helping her the best we can just to try to get her back on that career growth path where I know that she wants to be. Um, overall the team is solid. We're continuing to align and get that face to FaceTime and and grow the morale, which I know is hugely important with the team. Thanks for meeting today.

"Hi, Rebecca. Um, thanks for meeting with me today on such short notice, but I wanted to connect with you about Anna. Um. First off, um, I'm gonna have a difficult conversation with you. Is that OK? May I? Alright, great. Thank you. I'm just going to cut to the chase um going to recommend or I, I am recommending that we let Anna go. I know um, you're a big fan of hers and I know that we've kept in contact on her performance. As you know, I met with her about three months ago and laid out a sensually the steps for a performance review. Um, Anna took it very seriously. She immediately wanted to know how she could get back up to here as we know. She was more down here as far as performance goes. Wanted to step it up, wanted to really get to that elevated part of the team and where we need her to be. And she was doing good for about two months, but for the past month, since that three month check in, she's just starting to come back down again. Um. Outside of her performance, her personality has really been toxic, but the team and I've noticed that team members don't want to work with her. It's creating more taxes, tax did toxicness amongst the team and it is really just a detriment to the overall output. I know that you have um. A place for her. And we care for her and we all do. And I think. She can find. What she really, truly wants to do and be happier elsewhere, um. So I would like along with your blessing, to have a discussion with her and then make those plans, then let her go as of this Friday. Thank you for your understanding, Rebecca. Cool, sounds good.

No repeat these errors. Right. That's part of the plan, this, this kind of people are going to. There was some give us a few ideas and what improve next. Uh, based on that, we are going to try and.

"My goal for this team is to create a system where workflows easily from one person to the next. So we have struggled with UM project management in the past and ensuring that we have a system for moving work along the pipeline. So what will happen is that will receive a brief from the strategy team, the strategy team will then brief the creatives, creatives will start their work and the timeline will be managed by a project manager along the way. Myself and my partner Eric as creative directors will be there to guide the team through each step of the process. Reach out with questions, any concerns, any issues, come to us first and we will manage it for you so you can get the work done when reviews are ready. Your job at that point is to reach out to Eric and myself. We want to see work when it's at its best point, but if you have a thought or a concern along the way, send it to us and we will. Work along that process throughout our goal for you. We would love to see you operate independently. We would love to see that. At a point, we won't even need to review the work. We want to trust this team enough and the quality of work that they're producing to be able to, at the end of the day, send it off to the client without us even needing to review it. Because we know, and we can trust that our team knows exactly. Knows the brand so well that they won't have to that we don't need to take a second look at it. You know, working at that level is what this agency expects. This team, you know, working on the United States Navy business, we have to operate in a little bit of a higher level because it is a government client because it does get so many eyes at the end of the day. So we love to see you improve your work quality to reach that level. Of um, level of quality for the US Navy, you know, that's our overall goal for this team is to follow our project management process which will hopefully improve the quality of work and the time that we have to do it. Because up until now we know we've struggled with that and reaching that goal of a higher, higher level creative product is what's going to make us a stronger team at the end of the day.",5.0
"My philosophy is a manager is to lead with positive ITI you know, I I don't believe that anybody can do their job if they're feeling like they're constantly under the gun or psychologically insecure and what they're doing every day. So my goal is to encourage people rather than discourage people from the work that they're doing and how. Some ways that I think about doing that is the 1st way, UM is I want to make sure that I, my team knows that I'm going to be in the trenches. With them, there is no task that I would ask them to do that I wouldn't do myself, and I want to make sure that they know if they have a problem they can come to me there. For me their personal issues are always going to outweigh their work issues because you cannot do your job if you're worried about what's going on at home. And then the last way I would try to help my team is to um make sure that they know that there is the. The resource, whatever resources that they require, are accessible to them as long as they ask.

"On this current team, there are people we can operate, absolutely. There are people that we can operate without, and then there are people that I cannot operate without. So we have a team of juniors who are just learning how the process in AH and creative advertising works, and they do need quite a bit of supervision. And then we also have a senior team who they're seasoned, they know how to get things done, and I can count on them to get it done perfectly without any issues. Or complaints along the way. And then we have another senior who is struggling to um. I believe with some personal issues and then also with some quality of work issues and we've currently put that person on a performance plan to manage those expectations and show them that operating here is not OK and we're expecting a much higher quality of work. So that's our current team and our current roles. You know, I have one person on the team that I could hand the reins to tomorrow and I can guarantee the work would get done and it would be timely. But I don't think that person would be happy on this team. I think their skill set is so high quality that it truthfully belongs elsewhere at this point, and that's the best thing. That would be to help them grow, unfortunately. But I would hate to lose that person because of. The need because that would put much more stress on me. They would and they are my current #2 and my partner is still learning the ropes as well. So we have some dysfunction that we're currently working through to create the best product.",

"Hey there. I need to have a difficult conversation with you about John today. Is that OK? So John performed very well. After we had our initial conversation and our initial improvement chat, we brought in HR into the conversation. Expectations were made very clear of what he needed to accomplish in the quality of work that we needed to see coming from him. And it's been three months. We said we would regroup then and I don't feel that he is a fit for this team anymore based on the quality of work that I've seen. I think his he will perform much better elsewhere, whether it's on a different team or no longer with this company, but as it currently stands I am having to pick up the extra work that he is not accomplishing. At the end of the day, I would love your support in behind this and I would love to come up with a plan to work with HR to either transfer him to a team or his skill set. Might be a better fit or to remove him from the company permanently. I think he will be much happier at the end of the day because I don't think, I don't think his skill, I don't think he's using his skills to his full. Ability on this team because of the type of work that we do and I think it's causing him to lose track of what's important. So I'd love to see him either transition out of the company or transition to a different team. Will you help me support this at the end of the day?",6.0
"OK, so to build this idea, IKEA desk, we have 4 rolls that we need to work on the first person and we're going to break this up amongst each of us on the team. Each of you is going to have a single responsibility to build this desk. One of you is going to take on the instructions. We know deciphering IKEA instructions as challenging. So I think that role should belong to one person and one person alone. Two, one person is going to be in charge of the legs. So finding the legs, putting the legs together really. Um, owning that piece of the process. Three. One person is going to be in charge of everything that goes on the top of the desk, what the top of the desk looks like, how many pieces it has, um, whatever.

Screws, bolts, nuts, tools, pieces, parts. Any of that stuff is going to fall into that persons world. Now we all have to work together in this.

"My plan for my team really just comes down to implementing better processes this year. We don't have great systems in place currently and it makes it difficult for each member of my team to do their job and grow within their role. Having chatted with each member of my team, I know that they all have personal growth goals and opportunities that they want to take advantage of this year and by having better processes in place, they will have more time to attend trainings and learn more about those things and just grow. Additionally, so my team KP eyes are to launch our media plans on time if processes are in place. Not be a problem. We should be setting expectations across the board with other internal teams and have the resources we need in place to get those campaigns up and running. The second is to make sure our weekly pacing documents and regular reporting documents are filled out on time. Again, with process in place, that should be happening. And the third is to see growth across my team members and what they want to learn. So they each have a few specific courses they want to take and learn about, and I want to make sure that they have time to do those. I have a few strategies I'd like to put in place to make that happen. The first is to improve the functionality of our weekly status meetings and give each member of my team some chances to. You know, candidly say this is what I'm working on, this is what is coming up next week and these are the things I really need help on to make that happen and to do that in a laid back environment where they feel like they can ask for help and have a discussion and learn from other members of the team as well. The second is just to provide regular access to training opportunities. This is a priority across several members of my team, and I want to make sure they know what training opportunities they have within the media plant team and the larger team at BML Y&R. And then the third is to continue career path meetings for my direct reports. Make sure that they feel like they're having those conversations with myself and my boss on a regular basis in order to make sure those improvements are happening and have the improvement ideas in place. I would like to create tracking documents to help improve process on the client side as well and then really ask for the input of my team on, you know, checklist. How do they do things? How are they doing things you know that is helping them save time and how can other members of the team take advantage of their learnings as well, so creating a pooled knowledge space for everyone to collaborate better. At the end of the day, my hope is that by improving process and setting guidelines to do certain. Checkpoints within that, that we will be able to see growth across more team members, have more training in place and just be really more organized going into the next year.",6.0

That said, I want to make sure I'm setting realistic timelines, realistic expectations, unrealistic goals for my team members so that they feel supported across the board and the decisions they're making and the work they're doing. So I want to be available. I want to be candid. I want to have those conversations with them, but I also want them to feel like they have the autonomy to grow and make decisions for the team on their own as well and provide feedback. Because everyone. Those things differently and everyone can learn from another way of working or just another way of learning another way of communicating, and so I want to provide an open environment to be able to do that.",6.0
"Overall, the team is doing really well. Angela is really a Rockstar superstar across the cutie line of business. She manages everything day-to-day, has great relations with clients and is really growing into her mentorship role and it's exciting to see her step into that and be excited. Sam is newer to the team, but he is really proving himself to be a Rockstar, delivering his assignments on time and. Just asking really smart questions and diving in and you know, leaning into those training opportunities that he says he wants to be a part of. So he's really falling through with his actions on what he's telling us he wants. In the last couple months, Bryce has also grown significantly. She's really turning into a superstar across the Tennessee team. She's earning that trust from the CEI team and is confident in her recommendations and what she's providing. Everyone has some room to grow, obviously, myself included, but I do feel like, you know, from those three we're really seeing a lot of growth. Maddie has had some hiccups in the last couple months, but is really showing her commitment, improvement in commitment to improvement across that time period, and we're excited to work with her and see her, you know, achieve those goals. She sat for the last 3060 and 90 days. So overall, that's great from my standpoint. I definitely could use some work on delegating a little bit better and you know, providing more of a mentorship role across the team. So that's something I'm working on while allowing each of our team members to grow.",
"Charlie Irwin is my boss. He is a media director at VML INR and so he has a few different KPIs than our direct teams. So it's a little bit less of what he does is tide to client work. So he does want to make sure the clients across our teams are really happy with what we're providing them and what we're able to offer as their media agency. But he also wants to improve process and organization across all of the media teams at VML INR, help facilitate any new offerings and educate the team on what those are, whether that be. You know a programmatic desk and really make sure people are testing and using those offerings for their clients. And then for our team you know directly he wants to ensure that we're running smoothly, clients are happy, the teams are happy and that our teams are mentored and having growth opportunities as they like to have. So he does kind of a larger breath of things across the company, but it's definitely there for our team.",
"Hi Charlie. I wanted to sit down today and have a difficult conversation around Maddie's growth. I know we talked a couple months ago and helped her set some goals and we really did see some improvement from about here to here. But I've noticed in the past month she's really slid back down to even below where she was before and were, you know, having difficult time across the team getting the workload done since she's not able to perform at the level we would want or expect her to right now. Um, which I know is not wear any of us wanted to because she really is a great. Um, you know, a great friend and team member to a lot of individual members across the team. And unfortunately, at the end of the day, no matter how nice she is, we really need her to do her job. And I think given that we've had some difficult conversations directly with her and giving her some chances to improve and we're really not seeing that improvement consistently, then now we would need to have, you know, more serious permanent conversation around what does this mean for her to stay here because I think, you know, she's. Been here for eight months and is not fulfilling her job description. So how? Since we don't seem to be able to help her do that, I think we really need to have a larger conversation with each other and then maybe to HR and her around the fact that this may not be the best fit for her. This may not be a role she can complete.",4.0
"I would start by pulling out the pieces and sorting them and getting out the instructions, and then I would ask the team what their strengths are. Who could interpret the instructions the best? Who feels like they are the fastest or best actually physically putting the table together and going from there. Since I don't know what people might excel at, that's how I would approach it, is to give them a starting point to plan from and then allow them to have input, since I think that would be the best way for us to collaborate together and finish the table in, eh? Reasonable amount of time.",6.0
"OK my manager plan is. All around building process and um, making things smooth for my team members because neither of them work in the same office as me or in the same clients. Our KP eyes are more administrative and agency and efficiency focused. So our overall strategies are to build team skills and confidence, contribute to the larger analytics teams resources such as culture trends and then also getting daily team updates. Into projects without me micromanaging because I don't want to do that. And then our overall team KPIs are to deliver two to three proactive reports per year that provide additional value but haven't been asked for. And then our second P is to hit an 85% availability in terms of overall hours and productivity. And then thirdly to implement a project tracking system that we update daily so that I can be in the know about what they have going on. And help keep things moving along for their individual clients. Um, so our first process KPI is to implement Gantt charts in Smartsheet's to get all of the project tracking system set up and getting that into a routine of updating that on ongoing basis blockers would be? Time and making us a priority since that's more like administrative task versus uh client task. Also there's lack of skill and new to agencies with both my direct reports have been here six months or less. So I think a lack of skill and justice being new to the ways of VML INR is something that is a little bit of a block for them. Um 5% improvement ideas would be to meet with my team weekly formally and then informally twice a week just to check in and make sure they're feeling like they're part of the team since they are remote from me. And also connect them with mentors in their specific offices to make sure that they're building skills and have another resource person to learn from. And then also making sure that I'm keeping on top of the um percent bill ability to avoid five week low averages. And then another process, KPI, would be to learn one new analytics kill per year. And then from a calendar perspective, I listed everyone's birthdays and work anniversary's to celebrate the team um overall and then for March, have a goal for delivering a proactive report #1 and then November as a goal month for delivering a second proactive report just to make sure we're staying on top of that particular KP.",4.0
"So I'm not sure my management philosophy has changed too much since the first video, but I definitely feel like I now have more confidence and skills to be able to fulfill that philosophy with my direct reports. Um, I still feel that um being a manager means being kind of a guide for direct reports to provide a safe space for them to feel supported to help guide them. Through their career and giving them or making sure that they have opportunities for their own personal growth and to achieve their goals, whatever those may be. Um, I believe it's important to be honest and direct with that team 'cause I think that's the only way that's going. They're going to feel like they can trust me as well, um, and I really think like trust overall as a big core element of being a manager.

"So Tushar, um is, I've been really proud of the progress he's been making recently. A little while back I had a tough, honest conversation with him, um, because of the feedback I've been getting about him and his attitude with the people. He's been working with UM and really laid out all of the areas of the skills he needed to develop um in order to really help improve relationships with the people that he works with and just overall. Deliver higher quality work output. He was very receptive to that conversation. Wasn't sure how you can take it at first, but um, he's very receptive to it and seem to have taken that feedback very seriously. Um, and really has turned things around. I'm very proud of the changes that he's made, um, and the progress that he's made in such a short amount of time. He seems very honest about the areas he needs to improve and the areas that. He is doing really well at and has a lot of really good goals lined out for his next year and seems to have a plan for everything, so very, very proud of the progress that he's made. David, on the other hand, I need to have a tough conversation with him next week. Kind of a similar boat that Tushar was in is where David is at right now. Um, not seeing a lot of really great work output or a lot of productive time spent. So I've outlined a plan. For him to improve that development. So will be delivering that and speaking with him next week and hoping to turn his progress around as well. He's new, he's only been here two months. So I think there's just a lot of opportunity for growth. He just has some higher, um. More direct goals and advanced schools about how he wants to move up.

But he's also in the weeds of analytics similar to me. So we do have some overlap in in that way. But I really am happy with the relationship I have with my boss. He's has a lot of trust in faith and need to be able to do my job, but he's also always available if I feel like I need support in anyway.

I know this is something that we've worked hard to try to improve their performance. We did speak with them a few months ago about performance. We saw slight improve improvements, but they've really slipped back into. Their old habits and at this point it's jeopardizing our relationships with the client. So I really feel like it's best if we, you know, let them go. Um, would love to hear your thoughts about this or um. If you have any other concerns or questions, um would also love to discuss with you um, the you know the best way to speak with this person or invite you to do that with me if you'd like to.

"OK, so here to discuss what my management plan is for my team here at the end of the summit. Meanwhile, I look up at my plan here that I have, but generally adding to the growth of our editors. Um. Through communication and regular checkins. Um. It standards and best practices creating some of those so that it makes our day today a little bit more. Easier to to get through without having too many questions or having to reach out too often. Um, it it will be documented and trained on those processes. And lastly, I want to work through harboring creative growth amongst the editors. It's something that I haven't had a chance to do a whole lot, um, either by allowing them to attend a conference or training of some kind or or one to one working with me and any other creative editors to bounce ideas off each other, just grow creatively in that sense. So. A general. Ah, thought behind all of this is just growth. Um. And in communication as far as. The process KPIs here on that management play in UM. Looking at maybe documenting what the process is and what the number of items are that we need to to have created and have a process for that way we can. Look at how many we've we've completed and not completed and then um as far as the second KPI here, creative reviews actually scheduling or or making it a regular thing where we get together to review at its videos that we've worked on to see how how everybody is growing with the techniques and whatnot that we've hoped to build amongst the editors there. So as far as the improvements. And the 5% improvement ideas, it's just document shape documentation for tracking those things, documentation for standards and best practices for the tracking of the creative growth, most likely through meetings or note meeting notes and whatnot. And just generally looking to have more regular and organic meetings with the team just to see how everybody's feeling are kind of those 5% in key and um improvement ideas. And generally the blockers for me and my team is we have usually irregular availability could be in an edit for hours on most days and up to a week where where you're pretty tight down. So the availability of me and the team is kind of our main blocker there.",2.0
"Here I'm being asked to explain kind of what my management philosophy is. If I were to put it simply, it would just be that I am in service to my team members. They're not in service to me. I am there to make sure that they are able to do their jobs successfully and effectively without any of the issues that can come. And it's my role to to handle those and not theirs. So I want to be a manager that works for the team. And that I am, I am there for them. They're not there for me by doing a few a couple of different things. I think that's that's where I will be that kind of manager and that is generally just to protect their time and find find ways for them to not be. Waiting on feedback or having to work too late into the day. So those kinds of things are what what I'm hoping for and secondly, protect their creativity and build their creativity.

"So here I'm we're looking at discussing what. Talking about our team with in theory is if we're talking with our boss. And explain it to them kind of our feelings about the team and where they are. So for me, I do have direct ports, but they are, I would say, more autonomous maybe than most. So I don't interface with them. Day today all that often it might be once or twice throughout the week for some of them even maybe not even for a week or so with others. But generally the editors that I don't connect with is often are better at handling their own day today and not much of a need for me to be around as often. But there are a number of lower level editors that I do hear from quite often or need to be involved. With more regularly and going through this process of the management training it's I may need to kind of switch that up a bit to where I'm focusing in with the stronger performers and helping them grow versus some of the weaker performers and. And that's that's a reframing of my mindset 'cause I want to help the weakest to become strong and stronger. Because I feel that the stronger team members are able to handle their own issues if they come up or they don't need my assistance as much as the weaker reformers. But I I see the value in building the stronger team members and making them better and that would also in turn probably allowed those team members to to. The weaker team members and not me directly so but that that is kind of my assessment of how I feel about the team broadly. Thank you.",

It really really given them a chance to work through some of their issues as as you know there's been flaws in in errors and the videos that they've they've put out and you know just missing feedback, not addressing notes from the team from the creative teams that were needed to be included in an updated rounds of of the edit. Worked with them. Also you know more directly to see. The edits before they go out do a little Q eh a number of things that I caught but but they they clearly were missing the mark and and after having improved for a little while. Have slipped back into to having a number of errors in their edits. At this point, I don't believe that they'll be able to break out of that habit of maybe. Being, uh, being better at catching those things, I I feel like they're just going to keep coming back to. Having those errors and it's it's actually becoming I think a concern for the business to where the that team that we're working with um. Is is looking to pull the work that they do with our department and go elsewhere with it. So it's not just a question of um, can this person be saved or worked with to address these needs. It's it's a concern for lost, lost business. So I I think that at this point it's a conversation we have with HR about letting this person go.",2.0

Then from there, look at the. Look at the instructions themselves. Uh and divvy up who may be strongest for one piece or the other? Um. Some people may be better with their hands physically, others might be more organized and identifying who could do what as far as like organizing the pieces. And then another person assembling and in what order needs to go 1st and leaving the glass top till last.

"Maclin from the team for the next year is to focus on monitoring and making sure that all of our alerts and everything are working correctly and that we're not worrying about not watching the correct things, but.

But anything that we can do to manage our monitoring and and update made how we're monitoring in but we're monitoring and is going to be er focus going forward. But hopefully as we can gain new business, the some of those priorities will change. But as of right now that's the only thing that I'm working towards. It's coming up especially with the reduced staff. Um. One thing is that since the landscape is always changing, we're always going to have to deal with coming up with. Matching whatever changes that eh WS makes eggs and updating for that that and managing the to make sure that we know when those changes are happening and how to delete those changes.

And I have to remember that I've got explained some of that stuff that I've just taken for granted, but I know that. 25 plus years of dealing with some of this. Uh, there's things that I just know that I don't even realize. Most people have never even touched or even understood. So it's it's great being able to teach that information and see the AH has as they learn some of these new things, things that I've just taken for granted for so long and that it's it's great knowing that I'm in passing that information on and hopefully I'm teaching them um. Why some of those things are the way they are and how they are and hopefully someday they'll be able to pass into that knowledge on to somebody else those. But it is very taxing at times to realize that. How much of that stuff that I just don't remember. Or I don't think about that people didn't deal with or didn't have never had exposure to us so. It does make it it definitely interesting not working with as many people that are at my level for so long so. It's been it's definitely a challenge.

"My team member is Megan and she is currently a project manager on my team. She is aiming to be a senior project manager and get promoted and continue to move up within the delivery department into program manager role. She has been in her position for a few years now and has also bounced around managers for some time which is making her feel frustrated and neglected and also kind of lost on the path of promotion elevation within our department. My plan for Megan is not only to help her get the promotion and be visible by giving her opportunities to own tasks that she hasn't had familiarity with or exposure to before. Having her own burn reporting which is 1. Being involved in scoping. For our team to have a voice in the decision making process, to be able to analyze and look at the deliverables and the amount of people it's going to take on the right skill sets and then be able to evaluate her decision as she owns that work moving forward for next year. Her past experience has lent her to a more structured environment, which I think we can maximize. That skill set and really enhance her. A benefit to the team by giving her opportunities to provide more structure for an ever growing team, she is able to put parameters around things where there is more LAX right now and I think that finding a middle ground between both of those areas is going to be beneficial for both her and the team.",6.0

"I'm alisa. I know that you, when you first gave prints to me to help, mentor and manage, you were really rooting for him. You thought he had a lot of growth potential and opportunity to succeed within our organization and to contribute and was just a really talented individual and we wanted to help him grow. And I identified areas that I thought would be good for him to get exposure to because of his current client work base, just not giving him the opportunity to. Excel and show his project management skills. I talked about him about areas of business he was interested in and he really wanted to get promoted as well, but to do so his current work wasn't showing him those project management techniques. So he was able to get with the wall and start to do so, however. She and I both are in alignment and agreement that he's not following direction, while he is being given the opportunity to learn from the ground up and start simple, following a checklist so that we can see how he processes instructions and he is skipping over that. He's not taking notes. He's great at communicating with clients, but the problem is he's not. Following through with the work that needs to be done.

"I'm Melissa. Meghan is doing well. She is. Trying to open herself up for input and feedback from the team members that have expressed it to myself about her involvement and knowledge of the work. They are having problems where they feel that she is not having a voice in meetings more because she's not comfortable with the work and that she is not responding timely to deliverables that clients are asking for. They feel that she needs to operate in too much structure and is uncomfortable with work in progress or some ambiguity or generalizing things in order to get things out the door to clients. When the clients are comfortable with, um, more basic framework for timelines, for example, they don't need all the details. They just would like to see a road map of um phases that we'd be at for the work and roughly how long it would take versus specific dates and specific tasks. So I've been able to give her the feedback from the team members, and I applaud her because she's actually gone to the individual team members and ask them to provide her feedback real time as they're seeing it in meetings. So that way she can learn from specific examples versus generalities, which is something that I also encouraged the team undoing because it's easier for myself. Also, if I'm getting that feedback, knowing specific examples, I can put myself in Megan shoes and determine if I would do the same thing or what advice. I could give her on how to handle it differently in the future.",
"I've identified some ways for us to increase our capacity as proofreaders within the agency. Um, there are several things we're going to start doing as a team and. Individually to. Um, make us more effective. So the first thing we're going to do is. Um, we are going to try and increase our bill ability from Q3 to Q4 by 20% each. Um, I know this could be tricky because we do still have internal needs, but if we could spend more time with our client work, like if we could add an hour or 90 minutes a day that we would have previously spent on internal needs. We're going to talk about exactly what that means and how we're going to balance that. But if everyone could do that, we're also going to be getting reaching out to more client teams rather than making sure the internal teams are taking care of. We will still do that work. But we also need to really focus on Bill ability this quarter. So that is something each of us need to do individually as a team. Like I said, we're going to try and reach out to more client teams. Everyone might have an assignment to talk to someone or e-mail someone and solicit work and see what their needs are, so that's something we will be working on. Um, we're also going to be having check in so we can discuss this. I will track the bill ability. You don't have to worry about that, but we'll have checkins every week or every other week depending on how the month is going to. Assess this. Something that we want to build toward as a whole as a team is becoming not just approving department, but maybe a copy studio or copy services or we're still playing with the name, but that is something. If you have any ideas I would love to hear them. Instead of just being proofreaders, and might encompass having editors and. Writers and maybe the medical editors join us in the proofreaders from Miami join our team, but it'll be more of a studio or services group that can accommodate more needs. Um. And one final thing. We're gonna I'm gonna start trying to audit for consistency. And. I'm sorry, the.

Personally, they don't need to get personal, but I want them to feel comfortable talking to me about what. They need from me and most well, not emotionally that seems a little too extreme, but just what they need. So I want everyone to always feel comfortable on my team and we make decisions together about what's right for the team.

"And notice that my team lately feels a little bit burned out. I I think the agency is asking a lot of us and we don't always feel like were recognized for that. And like I've had a few people just make comments about, you know, here layoffs are happening and they would like more clarity on that. And they're concerned because. They're being asked to be more billable, even though we're doing work that's. We're working 100% of our time even though it's sometimes it's internal numbers. Even when we're using those, it is a lot of work. So it's just it's really hard to do what we do 8 hours a day and then sometimes be expected to continue it into the evenings and or on weekends. And if we could know for sure that we're getting merit raises or even cost of living raises at this point because inflation has really hit. Everybody, eh, especially with gas, which I know is stabilizing a little, but now that we're expected back in the office three days a week, it's just something to consider because we haven't heard much about. Raises recently and that's just. Where we are right now. Um. Everyone seems like happy they they don't. No one seems to want to leave. Happy might not be the right word, but everyone seemed satisfied with the job. They just like maybe a little more recognition of what they're doing and how their work is being valued.

"So the topic I'm going to talk about today is. My my favorite product? Which? Is technology. I think cell phones are so interesting and they are such a center point of our lives today. You know, from connecting to our medical devices, to our friends and family and our networks, one of the biggest things that changed my life has been the ability to connect my my diabetes pump, which I use for insulin, and monitoring my blood sugar, to my phone. Um, it's enabled me to have more flexibility and control in my day-to-day life. I can now go out and do things that I otherwise wouldn't be able to. Do when I was a diabetic who didn't have a closed loop system and and those technologies have really, really advanced over the course of the time I first got diabetes as a 14 year old to where I am today. And that 20 year journey has been really amazing to be on and see all the power that is harnessed within our cell phones and how it's able to process and use that information that's being sent by the sensors to. Change the amount of insulin I get, as well as my freedom and my flexibility throughout the course of my day and week and years. So it's really been great. And one of the interesting advancements that's coming is now that they're taking the power of the cell phone and putting it into watches, right? So now the next iteration is going to be, I don't have to carry my cell phone with me if I'm going for a swim or a hike or jog, I'll have my blood sugar.

"Did you know that an average person walks about 7500 steps per day? Or at least that's the recommended amount? What does that really mean though? I think if you think about in terms of distance and time, I think it makes it a little bit more tangible. So 7500 steps is roughly about three 3 1/2 miles and it should take roughly an hour to complete that. Um, it's a gauge, which I guess it depends on the step, the length of your stride. Um, people who tend to be shorter will walk a shorter distance and people who tend to be longer will walk a longer distance within those 7500 steps.

"Hi everyone I would like to describe to you how to putt a golf ball. Hopefully you can learn this at for your next mini golf game with friends or family or the next time you find yourself in the course and managed to find your way onto a putting surface. Hopefully this can help you. So first, some fundamentals. Here. I have a golf ball upside down. Um, so here. They're all different types. Here my favorite one is Callaway. Pick one and stick with one. It's great way to get a feel for the ball and draw a line on it. Straight line like I have here. I'll explain why later. 2nd is the power. I have an example here. Putter straight surface. This is what will be impacting the ball. It's all about comfort and feel. Um has a flat surface and it's it's really what gets the ball moving. Second or third is reading the green. Here, um. Steady location reading the green, which is how to determine the slope of the green. Many greens are. Left and right they have up and down slope and that determines which way the ball is going to go, whether it it scroll rolls downhill or to the right or to the left. And don't be afraid to look at it from different angles. Sometimes the sun or the light gives you a different perspective. Lastly is the setup. So here you line up the ball, you put it down on the surface, and you line up this line straight where it's going to go, where you think the ball is going to go. So it gets into a little hole. That you can make your pop. Grab the the putter here and you grab it like a baseball and. Grab it like a baseball straight away, just like this, and you put the ball in the center of your legs and you go back and forth just like this. Do not break your arms, just back and forth like a pendulum. Hopefully you'll get good at putting and impress your family, friends or family. Thanks for listening.",4.0

First, um, Envision 2 scenarios for a career path. One it's a straight Rd with ever increasing responsibility and reaching success in the end. The other is a windy Rd, more like a mountainous Rd. Lots of ups and downs, lefts and rights. Which one do you think represents reality and which one do you think represents expectations? Probably not too much a surprise that the curvy Rd which has represented my reality and likely similar to many of you. In the past 24 years of my career, it spanned across four different industries, aerospace, drug discovery, clinical diagnostics, bioprocessing, each with different job responsibilities ranging from process engineering, 6 Sigma, lean manufacturing. Project management and now product management. Um. Some of these changes were based on decisions that were because of world events. So September 11th, terrorist attacks here in the states impacting aerospace. That would be to change careers or business decisions like a divestiture of a business. It left me without a job, so I had to find another job at a different company. So what have I learned so far? Some key takeaways. First is accept ambiguity and change. There will always be some level of uncertainty and things that you can't change it. You can't control, so be flexible and open to new opportunities. 3rd is experiment. Go outside your comfort zone. You actually may find a passion that you didn't know you had. 4th keep focus on finding your passion and continuously sharpen your skill set. And lastly, patients. Truly a virtue. Thanks for listening.",4.0
"Hi. OK. So my name is Michelle and I am going to explain the plan for my team. I have five direct reports for them. Um are strictly day-to-day talent managers that lead different client teams. And then I have one other person that leads all celebrity negotiations. We all can do celebrity negotiations, but he is the lead. Um, the plan for the 2023 calendar year that I have is to make more effort of 1 on one time. Each individual as they all have different career paths and different goals that they have within the talent department. Currently we meet every Tuesday, um all of us and we kind of just like go over like things that we want to bring up client hurdles, client positive things, but I also want to be intentional of having one on ones moving forward. So I'm thinking maybe like a Friday like coffee chat type thing, make it more casual and so that I can really connect with each one outside of like a client issue or meeting. Um, so specifically with Nora, I want to continue to work with her on making sure that she uses her voice in meetings, is able to lead meetings, and also help her work on her presentation skills so we can start working on a talent 101 together and hopefully bring in one other person from our team as well. Um, our one on ones with April and Liz. I would want them to have some sort of like um. Path to continue to grow, to eventually like lead a whole city of clients possibly in the near future. It sounds from past in passing that that's something they wanted to do. So I'd really like want to focus on them and having real intentional client assignments so that they can make that happen in the future and then open to anything else they want. With Don. I want to work with her on, you know she's very like happy here she's. Voiced but she is looking more towards retirement so I want her to continue to give that knowledge back to our team knowledge exchange and help Nora and myself with the talent 101 as she has such a great wealth of knowledge and sad. Um with Gordon one and one. I want him to continue to help structure, uh, celebrity focus negotiation, um department and see if we need to like expand. What other resources do we need platforms to make everything more efficient. I want to make sure that he has the legal backup that he needs and as far as all of our team does well, the resources so that we can negotiate and redline these contracts affectively. And then I think by the end of the year, hopefully then that also helps that everyone feels like they have the psychological safety as we were taught. So they want to be apart of the team, apart of the agency and feel like fulfilled in their work moving forward.",1.0
"Hi so my philosophy for my team, I kind of um have tried to really. Ensure that there is psychological safety environment within my department. I've basically done this because of past experiences where I have not felt that way, so I know how it feels to not have be able to share my idea is or have uh, you know the good feeling about going to work that day or you know, being able to communicate freely with my manager. So I really just want to build a team where everyone. Can bring their ideas, have a really nice knowledge exchange. Everyone can be vocal and vulnerable about how they're feeling. Whether it's like, you know, I need a break from this client or I need some help or I need a day off. Like, you know, like really honesty and justice having, you know, communication between everybody, all six of us on anything that we need at any time. And honestly, I I've heard it first hand from my team that they love working with each other and really partner with each other and so that I feel like. Run the right path.",2.0
"Hi, Tyler. How are you doing, um? So our team. We have to work on some of the people's responses to emails. Like Gordon, I'm getting back to people. I think he just has a lot of he's in a different process of production than the rest of us are. And so he's kind of getting hit from every direction at different stages of urgency. And so I know for a fact that he is, you know, taking down notes and like has like A to do list. But I think that maybe, you know, it's almost too much. Maybe like we need somebody else. To help him, you know, whether that means like a full person or like me or Liz helping out with some of these deliverables 'cause I think it's just getting to be too much and that's affecting, um, you know, people. Feeling that they're not being prioritized by him, unfortunately, and I don't want that to be the case because as we both know, he brings a wealth of knowledge and we need to make sure that he is respected and given the proper amount of workload to be able to be a success here and not have anyone say anything differently. But the rest of the team is doing well. Nora's really stepped up when Liz was on maternity leave, which is amazing. She really. Started bleeding like the Wendy's team meetings, um. And she also started just like leaning in and volunteering to help anybody on the team that needed help. So she's really kind of like taking taking a step in the right direction as far as being more vocal on the team. Um, and actually surprisingly with lesbian attorney leave, it's been not too crazy. And Coke, I was little, you know, afraid that that was going to kind of go crazy. But because they didn't produce after June, really, we've been able to kind of like keep your head above water, but when she comes back in two weeks will be really happy just to have like more support on coke moving forward.",
"So my boss is ahead of production in North America and so he is responsible for all of the producers, all of the production business managers and all of my department, the talent managers. And he basically is there to make sure that every client has, if they need to produce a commercial that we have an assigned producer, production list manager and talent manager leading the way. He also is able to help with resourcing if we need to like hiring you. Talent managers producer is, if we like when a new client, he gets to build the team that's assigned to that that particular client to lead and he also is very involved in any new business pitches. And so like I'll work with him on you know ballpark in that sort of thing and seeing like is it sad nonunion. We work really closely together to execute that. The pitch, um. We also work together with creating processes. For instance, we have an influencer issues that we have within our department and so we're trying to work with other departments such as connections. My talent department just end with WP overall to get on a process in place so that we can support that type of process or that type of like. Business I guess you could say in general he also works with me closely on helping promote individuals on any staffing issues and Zach related issues. So he's just always available and just make sure that every client has coverage to produce commercials.",
"So I have to have a difficult conversation. May I? OK, so. I have Nora who has been not. Be you know, I've had to speak to her and let her know about Vocalising leading meetings, you know, not just doing the, AH, administrative type of work and she's just not delivering. And as a result, the rest of the team is having to lead meetings, set up the the trainings and do everything that she's supposed to be doing on clients. But they're having too, and they are also. Being resentful about it because now they're taking time out of their day-to-day eh clients to help hers and so that's obviously not fair. And also her role isn't become more admin and nature. So therefore we could hire someone that is not even at her level more junior to train them and to do it because there's no. Experience needed on the types of items that she's doing. So therefore, it seems like the common denominator here is to let her go. I mean, as a person she's she's great, but she's just not stepping up to be at the same level as the rest of the team. And she's seniors. So that doesn't sit well with everyone else because we can't. When I have a new client, I can't give it to her because she's not. Use the critical thinking skills, lead an onboard, train the the teams that are assigned and therefore I worry that that client is not get the full. You know. It's not to be taken care of to the to the same level of other clients. They're not going to get the same sort of on boarding and it's going to could be detrimental to the business and so therefore I just don't think she's a good fit any longer moving forward.",2.0
"So honestly, I don't know if I'm missing something, but this one I couldn't figure out what was the learning to explain what to tell the team to do. So I'm just going to say that we follow the directions we all pitch in as a team to try to be as efficient as possible and take anybody's ideas who might have to make us, you know, be successful and potentially be the winner. Um, at the end of the day, one of the things is like let's start like an assembly line. Like if somebody wants to be the lead to read the directions, somebody else, two other people maybe can be taking the things out-of-the-box. And you know, we can all kind of like tag team and just communicate efficiently. So if any like just, you know, using our words and trying to build this so that we can get the table all set up and ready to go.",3.0
"So my manager plan um is really based around the idea of growth. Um, our team. The, the main goal for us is to grow and to continue to contribute in that way to the agency. And I kind of broke it down in, in several ways that I think are going to be useful tactics for us to grow, continue to contribute in a meaningful way. So key goals for us are going to be to engage new teams at the agency um, continue to expand our team skill set outside of the types of design that we're doing right now and then also streamline the way we work within. The agency, there are so many different small pieces that come together within VM INR, finding a way for our team to more easily work with in all of those different operations, um, so-called operations, I think will be a really big opportunity for growth within our team, um. So one of the improvement ideas that I had for this was to kind of send our team out on the road again, what we used to call the Creative Services Roadshow to introduce ourselves again to the agency. So people who would benefit from working with our team have an opportunity to meet us to learn what we're capable of and how to engage with us, which I think can sometimes be a blocker for people outside of creative services and who maybe don't have a great understanding of what our team does right now. Um, some strategies that I think would be useful in sending us forward in into our CPF growth is um. Using kind of our current work workload and forecasting the way that our current workload has been going to understand how many resources we might be able to support moving forward into 2023. Um were already on a great path to getting. More members added to kind of give us the competitive edge in taking care of more work. I think we can standardize and streamline our meetings so that resourcing is quicker and more efficient and that we can kind of get get things assigned faster and make sure that our team stays as busy as possible and then I think. Figuring out the way that our time keeping systems works within the interagency. Working will be a huge help in how we can continue to work faster, better, smarter with all of the teams at the mill liner and that will contribute in a great way to us growing and continuing to be a valued team.",4.0
"When people join our team, we tell them that we're only ever going to ask them to do three things. First, we're going to ask them to think. Second, we're going to ask them to bust their *** and 3rd going to ask them to care. And if you do the third one, the first two RTZ. So my management philosophy is to give people a reason to care about the work that they're doing and to make sure that they feel engaged, and then give them the tools that they need to do their best work in a way that makes them feel good about what they're doing. Um, I think that the most important thing that you can give to someone in. In a management position is just support. Um. So my job is to be here to support them, to find a way to do work that they care about in a way that they find fulfilling and kind of let them find their best way to grow.",5.0
"Adam, hey, yeah, let's talk about the team. Um. You know, I think everyone is in a really good position. Uh, we have. To keep to keep growing on the team, I don't feel like we have anyone right now who is actively looking to move off of the team, which is kind of a unique position for us. Um, I think it's really, really nice to see that people are thriving with the work that we're giving them and are enjoying it. Um and are making an impact on the teams that they're working with. Um, I think we're getting a lot of really good feedback from the creative leaders that they're working with outside of our team. Um, I I love to see the way that the newer people, which is about half of our team at this point, have really come into the rules that they are. Are in and they're doing really well and getting a lot of good, good feedback from the leaders that they're working with. Have been super impressed with the younger people on the team, especially Kylie, who's right out of college and is asking better questions in meetings than I did even a couple years ago. Um, overall, I think, yeah, I think our team is just we're we're set up for a really good successes with the people we have right now.",
"My bosses role at the company is the Director of Creative Services and what that means is he is responsible for keeping our team eh very billable and very profitable part of the company. Um, we are an especially useful team for the creative groups. So that means that he needs to be aware of how much I remember of our team is working on billable clients. How much we are able to contribute to the overall creative efforts at the company and how we can most efficiently grow our team to be a profitable and efficient piece of the creative machinery at VML winery.",
"Adam, I need to have a frank conversation with you. May I? Great. So several months ago when we were having that performance issue with Joe, we spoke about it and his performance improved, improved slightly. But in the last several months, it's really been back to the position we were in when he was having the problem initially. Um, I think at this point it will be better to let him go than to continue to try to find the root of the problem. Um, I know that, that he's always. When someone that you, you root for and that you would like to see succeed here. But I think we've we've taken him as far as we can and without. Without any more. Kind of. Without any more effort from his side, I don't. I don't see this problem improving and I think the best course of action is just going to be for us to to let him go.",5.0
"OK team, we need to assemble this IKEA desk with drawers. It has a glass top, so we're going to need people who are very delicate with things. So first I want to start with a scale of 1 to 5125. Have you built an IKEA desk before? Let's see, OK, I'm seeing a lot of twos, I'm seeing a few threes. There's 15. So we're going to put you, we're going to put you on building the column of drawers. Were going to get someone else that's similar semi qualified to help you out with that. Now on a scale of 1-1 to five, again, show me how clumsy you are. OK, I see. I see one. One, we're going to keep you off of the glass top. OK, great. So team, we're going to break into teams feel, find, find the people who feel like they're the same level of qualified as you are grouped together and like let's get started building this thing.",5.0
"The key part of my manager plan for the year is to really work with my direct reports for Betterment for themselves, but also to help our department, um, I think with the client work we do, that can be very fickle. Sometimes things change, priority changes, priorities change. So it's difficult to try to align on KPIs or deliverables at the onset of a year for direct reports when so much can be up in the air as the year goes on. What I want to focus on is helping. My direct reports obtained certifications in training that can tie back directly to client work, but also just increased their knowledge set and eventually promote them out of being a direct report of mine. I see that kind of turnover, whether it's promoted to my level or moving into a different role if they find that things are not a good fit for them is the. Is a key benchmark for success for any department, um. As part of this, my strategies for the year again are to increase certification rate among directs. Report Direct reports helped spread the allocation of direct reports across multiple clients in order to give them more of a knowledge base and skill set and just keep their interest level high and then again increase that urgency to promote out of direct reports. In order to do this, we're going to have. Training checkins. Every other week during our one on ones at the start of the year. I want them to spend time aligning on a training and certification program that fits what they want to do with their career and also matches with client work. Some of the blockers are going to be timing to dedicate to learning. However, if we can align programs with clients that is billable work, I believe that that should limit any issue with allocation. We are going to have quarterly presentations on the learnings and opportunities that they're finding. Again, everything that they learned should be tide back to something that they see with the client. For instance, if they're on Adobe client and they're going through a EMM certification finding opportunities through that training that. They can apply to a client, would be a valuable learning and presentation and help them turn training into a clear cut. Client deliverables at the end of the year that KPIs or we're going to have monthly learning share outs in lieu of 1 on one. So I want them to teach me what they're learning at a high level and so they can position themselves as the expert and also get familiarity with presenting to a client with opportunities like this at the end of the year. We want them to have one client or individual LED training certification completed. There should be some sort of finality to that training at the end of the year and hopefully this is more of a personal KP. I don't know if it's possible, but I would like a 25% direct report turn over again through either each year again through either. Uhhh promotions or they find a role that they are better suited for based on what they learned throughout the year.",4.0
"My management philosophy has grown over the last eight weeks and now I want to be a manager that's known for direct feedback after developing an atmosphere of trust and transparency. I want my direct report to be able to comfortably come to me with their problems, whether that's at the workplace with a client with the deliverable. But instead of jumping right into solution ING with them, I want to be known for giving guided direction through the DOC. Approach, I want to make sure that they know that at the end of the day it is up to me to hold them accountable, but it's up to them to solve their problems. I think that is a key differentiator. Differentiator that I need to focus on is again providing that direct feedback, but after developing that atmosphere of trust, trust and empathy to make my direct reports OK with opening up to me.",5.0
"Hey, Joanna Global could be today. I just wanted to give you an update on how my individual reports and my team is performing and the growth um seeing in them. Um definitely the star of the bunch is Colleen. She is a proactive go getter. She's very open and honest about the issues that she has with clients or with work and she's very good at problem solving but also being collaborative with that problem solving. The sky is the limit in terms of potential. She should be in a department leadership. In the next three to five years. At VML Y&R um, Next up we have Lana Richie. She is a problem solver and she is kind of more under the radar. Some of the difficulties that she deals with our lack of desire and a lack of maybe professional professionalism to go in front of the clients. Part of that though is, OK, she's an individual contributor. We just need to make sure that she can understand the bigger picture to deliver the process goals that we need with content management to keep the ship. Running um, we have Billy Karanja up next. He's a new direct report for me, but from everything I've seen, he's per active. He is definitely motivated. I think some of the things that he's struggling with though, I think it's unclear where he wants to go in his career. He's trying to do a lot and I think it's difficult for him to hone in on how to develop fully when he doesn't know where he wants to go just yet. Finally, we have Adam Rodenberger. Um, I think that one of the issues with Adam is he lacks self-awareness to see the. Issues he's struggling with. Um, he doesn't have great attention to detail and he over complicates things because of that because he gets so far down one path, but he missed a key detail. I don't know if this is the right role for him, but he's definitely a. He definitely wants to learn, but we need to help him develop that self-awareness to realize the mistakes he's making at the time he's making them, as opposed to too far down the line.",
"My boss is Joanna may, she is a director of marketing technology at VML INR horror role in the company is to really lead the strategic village vision of a clients marketing technology stack. This systems they use, the enterprise level systems they use to give them best practices for how to use them and also how to make them work more smartly together. Um some of the key things that she delivers upon our personalization automation. And really handling customer data and developing a strategy for how to use that data again legally and ethically, but to deliver brand promises throughout all of their systems. Her big thing is making sure technology is connected and working as best it can. Um, she is one of the most brilliant people candidly at this company and is definitely an asset to my growth at VM INR.",
"Hi Joanna, I need to have a difficult conversation with you. Is now a good time? Fantastic. As you know, a few months ago we discussed a performance improvement provement plan for Bob. We knew at the time that he was underperforming and that he was struggling with some work life balance issues that was leading to less than stellar results for our clients. In terms of his deliverables, um, we did see improvement with Bob in the coming weeks. After that it seemed like it really lit a fire under him. However, the further we have got away from. When we installed that Pip, um, his work has suffered and it seems like Bob is really struggling with taking personal accountability for what he delivers at work. I think at this point I need to recommend that we let him go. I do not think this is the right team or the right opportunity for him. Quite honestly, my biggest concern is a lack of personal accountability. Again, when we installed the PIP, he was very motivated. And he asked for weekly Checkins and we gave him those updates knowing that that's not. Maintainable, not sustainable forever. Um, as we gave him more more freedom to ensure that that performance improved, he has dropped his performance. Um, it seems like he needs that ownership, excuse me. That visibility and that that oversight from leadership to make sure his work is delivered in his role. We can't have somebody holding his hand all the time. I don't think this is the right opportunity for him. And because of that. I think was time to let him go. In summary, again, we saw improvement, but Bob just needs more oversight than we can give him, and we need to let him go and find somebody that's more suited to work autonomously.",4.0
"Hi team, because building this IKEA desk can be divided into 3 parts with two of them being very more substantially labor intensive, let's divide into teams of two will have two people focus on building the legs of the desk and two people focus on building the drawers of the desk. Um. First thing though, let's divide all the parts by where they come through. Legs, drawers, decorative top. Um. Once we get the legs built as the drawers are being built will make sure that we are aware. Of what the other team is doing well, have a point person for each team that is seeing how the big picture is coming together at the end, because the decorative top is going to be more fragile and we need to handle it more carefully. The four people are two teams will come together and we'll place the decorative top on top. Um. At this point, though, let's divide into teams of two drawers and legs and will focus on those more parts. Heavy sections of the desk.",4.0
"So as the director of the mobile app and Emerging tech team, there are really three key strategies I want to employ this year for the team. So one, I really want to have regular syncs with other client teams to confirm the satisfaction and growth opportunities among current clients in order to increase our billable and are billable rate and revenue among each client. Second, I want to build repeatable processes and. Templates within the work so that we can be more efficient. And three, I want us to be the go to subject matter experts throughout the organization on this topic. So the way that we're going to measure these is 1 we're going to retain or expand our existing scope among current clients. Second, we're going to increase our client deliverables and outputs by 20% by having more repeatable processes and templates in place. And 3rd everybody is going to put together. One piece of practice content per quarter that helps further identify us as the subject matter experts in this particular practice. The first KPI I want to hit is meeting with all of the client engagement executives among the current clients that we're working with to understand current client satisfaction and furthermore where their growth opportunities. And the second process KPI is that I want to increase our deliverables, outputs and artifacts among clients that we have templates, repeatable processes, but also we can showcase to the client what we've been delivering on paper. The 5% improvement ideas that I want to help us get to these goals faster would be creating a shared drive on one drive so that we can access each others templates and repeatable processes more easy, more easily. And then I also want to get a new tool called apptopia that can help us with competitive analysis and doing some client mapping and understanding where some opportunities are within clients. The last thing I want to do is really. Get started. And so for the next month, I really want to focus on sharing this plan with the team. And then in the next month and the month of December, I'm going to go ahead and create that shared drive on teams. I'm going to help one team member with a specific project and playbook that he has for a deliverables. So I want to make sure that's buttoned up for the client. And then secondly, we have a new team member switching client. So I want to make sure she gets up and running and we're starting to identify where the opportunities are for that client.",5.0
"My management philosophy really is defined by three key areas. So the first is really understanding my team as people and who they are. So I really want to understand what their strengths are, what they like working on, what they don't like working on. And so then we can really identify where we can help them thrive and where they may want more coaching and where they want less coaching. And I really want to meet them where they are and not expect them to all be at the same level. And have the same strengths, but really see them as individuals. The second philosophy I really want to have is them feeling emotional safety, so I know that they're going to excel in their jobs when they feel emotionally safe at work and don't feel like they're in a hostile working environment. And 3rd is really about honesty. So I want them to know that I'm always going to be honest with them and transparent about where their work is at and where the company is at.",6.0
"So as you know, we have three people on the team I really look at. Brooklyn and Julia Bing are superstars and Trevor is a rock star who just needs a little bit more coaching. So Trevor has a great attitude, great collaboration skills. He comes from working in apps, um, but I still want to work with him on mastering the basics of life cycle and continuing to help him work on his presentation skills. So he really wants to stay in the mobile app space and be a better strategist, not just task oriented. So what I want to do is work with him on strategy. So I want to be a little bit closer to his work and help him understand the storytelling of his work and his presentation skills so that he can help guide the client through that strategy. One other way I want to do that is have him meet with other people on the team to share work and what they're working on. For Juliet, Julia is really a rock star. She is great at building relationships across clients and kind of navigating the political waters within clients and has a really strong background in mobile. So I never worry about her kind of having the fundamentals down. So I think for her, it's just finding the right opportunities for that personal branding and professional growth and continuing to have her put together deliverables that is establishing that mobile program within the clients. And then third with Brooklyn, Brooklyn is a sharpshooter. She, you know, is a master of tools and process. And so I really want to get her, um, the right opportunities within clients where we're doing a tool implementation so that she can be alongside somebody with that and start to build a repeatable process off of that. Um. And so that would be the summary of our team.",
"My boss is Adam and Adam as a group director of mobile apps. Until he really overseas, 2 key pillars within the app. Practice, one of which is my pillar. So he overseas sort of the product owners and designers and developers with the creation of the mobile apps and then also overseas the app lifecycle practice. And so as part of his job he make sure that we are all billable within our clients and he can help with resourcing and moving people around in order to stay above 85% bill ability on clients. And so if we lose a client, it's part of his role to make sure that he finds a home for people within client. Work and then secondly, he can find new client opportunities, so bringing in new business to the practice and three, he really make sure that we have the tools we need to do our jobs effectively.",
"Hey, I need to have a conversation with you about so and so's performance. Is now a good time? OK, great. Um, I need to talk to you about Joe um and letting him go. Unfortunately, he has been underperforming and missing deadlines. I've talked to him about other things that could be going on in his life, and it doesn't seem like there are external factors contributing to this. And so I think we really need to have a serious conversation about their future role within the company. You know, his performance really needs to be here and he's been consistently here. We've tried to get him here or here and it's just not working out. I know you really like him and you've been rooting for him. But after the recent performance improvement plan, I haven't seen anything change and really think it's time for us to move on. I'd really like for you to support me in this decision and can we talk about their future role within the company, because I feel like it's time to part ways.",7.0
"OK, team, we have to build a desk the fastest with the four of us. So there are four legs, a column of drawers, and a glass top. So here's my proposal for what we should do to win. Two people should work on building the four legs so each person builds 2 legs.

"So you may have heard that individuals only take on average 7500 steps per day. I'm proof of that. This individual is proof of that. I've got a Fitbit I monitor myself, and that tends to be true. And that was surprising to me, right? The goal most of us have is 10,000 steps per day and even 10,000 steps. Is that really enough? Um, the tricky thing is. It's not. It's not. You know, we all know when we have those good days and when we're over achieving and working in the yard and we have many, many steps that we take. But I think it's surprising, I firmly, certainly found it surprising how many days I really am only at that 7500 number or below. And again, we know those days that are below right, because we realize we've sat in the office all day. We haven't made it anywhere working from home. So awareness is key. Looking at the data really helps us make a change, make a difference.",5.0

"My favorite food is pizza and I want to talk to you about today about how I make pizza. So first of all I don't make the dough, I buy the dough. But a key step is you have to take the dough out in advance and let it sit overnight. That allows you to work with it otherwise would be too cold and won't stretch as much. Then you stretch out the dough to as big as you like. Um, I sometimes find it fun to make two smaller pizzas so you have more individual size and different options. And then I spread it out on a thin sheet pan, circular preferred. And to me the key step that I do is I take some really good olive oil and I brush all around the edges with olive oil and even have a little in the middle as well. Then you get all your ingredients and ingredients, really make the pizza. So a really good tomato sauce. I like to add some mushrooms, some sausage, some pepperoni. And, you know, use whatever kind of cheese you like. Some people like mozzarella, some people like Fontana. You could use whatever. Honestly, I don't. I don't use cheese. I just use the tomato sauce, the and the toppings, and that's it. And then my secret ingredient is I go around the edge and I sprinkle some salt on the crust. So now I've got my pizza. I've got a nicely thinly stretched crust. I've got good ingredients, starting with tomato sauce, and then I've got all my, my. Ingredients that I like any type of cheese if you want it. I finished it off with my. Salt. And then you put it in the oven, and the oven has to be extremely hot, as hot as your oven will go. 4:50 if you're using something inside, outside on a grill, something close to that, and let it bake for seven to 10 minutes. Get nice and crispy, and then there you go, you've got your pizza.",5.0
"Hey, I'm going to talk about how I ended up in my current role, which should be easy for me because I only started in this role about two months ago, so it's pretty fresh story. It started because um organization was actually restructuring. There are some change happening and it's part of my career development plan. Um was reached out to to see if I would be interested in a role in the new organization. Um, well, that didn't materialize. That activity that sparked 2 important activities. One um. I I had a conversation with my boss to talk about the timing of a change, right. I've been in my current role 3 three years, previous role three years. Was that too soon or would it be OK to make a change at this point in time? The second thing was it really forced me to think about what do I want to do next? You know, there's this this. In this case I was approached and there was, um, opportunities, but did it align with what I wanted to do? And that was a tougher thing to to figure out. While honestly some of the jobs, some of the roles in the new organization were interesting, they really didn't align well with what I wanted, with what I was missing. Um, but as often happens, there was a cascade effect. I didn't get one of those new jobs in the new organization, but somebody else did in them from the marketing organization, which is where I decided I wanted to be. I wanted to be in the marketing organization because UM didn't have that experience before. I've have commercial experience in operational experience and I wanted to understand how the business works. I wanted to understand how things happen on this side of the House. And I also wanted to get closer to the front end of decisions, technology decisions and the technology evaluations that help drive our business in the future.

It's not about the recipe, the source we can skip for now. Every source of course can have different flavors, but that's not the the key trick. The key trick is about the dough. How do you make it so? Take your famous recipe and the big change. What you have to do is use cold water, don't use hot water and let the dough stand for 12 hours. After 12 hours take out the dough, it should be a nice elastic dough. And then. Rapid to a small ball and then take from the top a little bit of dough, wrap it to the bottom and stick it. Attach it to the bottom. By this you embrace air into the dough and then it will get more fluffy. And most important step is then to bake the pizza. For this you need heat, heat, heat, heat. Put all your energy into their over. Use a baking stone which starts a lot of energy and. Put their pizza on on top of it. Because the pizza may only cook for eight to 10 minutes, so you need a lot of energy and heat to get it well done. Enjoy.",5.0
"Hello, let me introduce myself. I am a scientist by heart. Already as a young kid I was so much interested in natural science, so it was a clear logic to me to study. Uh, natural subject.

I I was involved in starting up a new startup company, was able to grow this company and we successfully sold it. It was for me a great experience to work as a interface of science and business and it was clear for me I want to stay in this area. So after we saw this company I was looking for a new job. However, I decided not to start in a state position. But guess what? This is where I ended up. I started in a sales position, but looking back it was a great experience for me because I had the chance to learn how our customers think, what their challenges are, what their needs are and what they are expecting from us as a solution provider.

Imagine the impact that we can have on our environment in the moment. Think about new opportunities in each day. The benefits are huge. Think about composting or trying on one new thing. If everybody thought in this way and you could try to reduce this goal by half, imagine these impacts that we could bring. So there's many options out there.

"Hi there. This is Heidi Murphy. I had the struggle as a mom to find a good game that I could involve all three of my kids at their different ages and stages of maturity that I actually wanted to play with them. So the game that I researched and found, um from asking around in my mom circles was the game headbands. And if you're not familiar with the game headbands, it's really quite easy. So you open up the very simple box, each participant gets a headband and you attach it to your hat. There's a deck of cards. On the cards there's a different image, and so even if your child can't read yet, they're able to visualize what the object is. So without the person who has the headband on um seeing, they apply a card to their forehead, and once it is on their forehead, the other participants have to describe that object back and forth with the person. So we bend the rules slightly here and there based on the children's ages and stages and capabilities, but normally you're supposed to have a clue and so the person who has it on their head said we'd say a characteristic that would describe the image. Um, that could potentially be on their head. Of course, they don't know what it is. So they would say, for instance, let's say the picture was a tree. Um, but they were. They didn't know what the object was. They would say, am I alive? And then all the participants would tell them the answer. So they get all of these clues to make an assessment whether or not they know what the object is. And so there's some cute cards involved that you could use it. The kids are a little bit older in age to help them guess, but it's really, really fun. And so each player goes around and around and take stern, and we try to do about 10 cards, then we finish up. So enjoy it.",5.0
"Hi everyone. When you were 21 years old, did you know what career or role you wanted to end up in? Well, I'm Heidi Murphy and when I was in that position, all I knew is that I wanted to be somewhere in the healthcare space and that I wanted to impact people's lives with products and services and supporting them in a business role. So I started out by assessing the opportunities at my university and I was able to take the opportunity to join an internship program. I got into the Siemens multinational division for medical devices and I started my career in product management. I was quite successful there and I was able to hold many different roles and expose myself into them. And then I decided to. Um, join another team and learn a bit more and extend my skills and experience in the Pharmaceutical industry. So I went to paraccel and there I was able to work with different colleagues in software development and further fine tune my skills and product management, but for a new client base and pharmaceuticals. So then I was able to grow and try on many different roles and that was quite successful for me, but I still didn't see the opportunity for growth that I thought that I was. Capable of and then I found Millipore, Sigma and Mark and hear my role has been quite an opportunity in marketing excellence where I have been able to bring together a lot of my historical skills in background and learning about ERP systems and different processes and many different companies and that landed me where I am today.

"Today I wanted to teach you about. Bananas. Now everyone might think as bananas as a healthy snack. Something that is filled with a lot of nutrients and potassium and can definitely help you alot after a workout or just if you want to snack on it. However, people have found that bananas contain a very trace amount of radiation. A lot of things do. Everything around you has a little bit of radiation. Your phone does technology, even water, will contain radiation. But it's to the point where, in order for the radiation from a banana to kill you, you would need to eat roughly 40,000 bananas within one day. So debating on if you want. Were to be able to eat that many bananas, I don't know if it would be the radiation that would kill you or if just eating all of those bananas would kill you. Another interesting facts about them is that monkeys actually don't really eat them that much. They are. Usually eating bugs I believe, and things like that, but they don't actually, even in US. Another interesting fact is that every banana that you have ever eaten is a clone of every other banana. They are basically a genetically modified fruit, but it is just simple like agricultural techniques of. Where they take banana trees are all split off from the original banana tree, and so they're pretty protected because there are certain funguses and bacteria that can completely destroy bananas. So if you hear sometimes about bananas might go extinct in 20 or 30 years, it's because of that and. That. Could definitely affect it, because if the fungus effects one banana, it affects them all and it could spread and wipe out bananas.",6.0
"My work related topic is going to be about cloud computing. Cloud computing is something that I recently got into recently and it's something that I am studying during my training. Now, cloud computing can sound very. Very confusing. Very hard to understand at first. But once you understand exactly what takes place during the cloud computing process, it's very easy to really comprehend how the processes might happen. Now, in General, cloud computing means that there are servers in other locations, rather than where you specifically are that are either saving or doing the processes that you need to be done for you. So let's say that if you were to create a Google document. On Google Docs and if you were to close your computer. That document would be saved because it is saved to Google Cloud. That means it's backed up on their server, backed up on our cloud. If you were to lose your computer, lose all your data, that data will still be safe. In reference to that, there is a lot of very interesting techniques and interesting things that can go along with this. One of the things that Microsoft has been doing recently is called Cloud Gaming. This allows you to play a video game on an Xbox console without needing to download it. It does this by running the game on their servers and they upload the footage basically to you. It does not require your device to need to. Run the processes for it and that's it. Is less intensive on your devices and you don't need to spend the time to download eh, hundreds of gigabytes game that might be a waste of time for yourself. The downfall to it is that the technology isn't specifically. Completely mastered yet the game will have some latency issues, meaning it might lag or there might be. UN sinks because you have to rely on the connection between you and the Microsoft server. Thank you.",4.0
"Hi. Today I'm going to talk to you about cloud computing. Now, cloud computing could be a very confusing technology and something that might be intimidating at first, but once you get to understanding the processes and how the functions of cloud computing work, it might be a little bit easier to understand. So first I'm going to explain to you how cloud computing might help your everyday life. Let's say that you are creating a Google doc on Google Docs and you were to shut off your computer or your power went out. You might think that all that information you had on that document might be lost. However, Google Docs does an automatic save every few minutes, so every few seconds where they will upload that document to the Google Cloud which is stored on their servers. This means that the file that you created. Every few seconds or whatever the interval is, it will be automatically uploaded to Google servers or they will save it for you and it is guaranteed to be safe. That is very basic understanding of cloud computing.",
"Hi, my too many talk is going to be about renewable energy. Now a lot of people might think that renewable energy is. Going to always be clean. It's going to always be the savior of the energy crisis. However, there are a lot of points against that that might show that. There have been issues in the past with it. However, I want to prove that no matter the costs. The. Pluses of renewable energy outweigh the costs, that is, from non renewable energy such as coal, oil, natural gas. No, bull energy does not have any byproducts. There's no after the fact that energy is produced. There's no product at the end that is going to cause harm to the environment and the people around it. Renewable energy is also. Very cost safely. There's a lot of evidence that points that having solar panels is a better investment than opening up a new oil refinery or power plant. These things have had a lot of evidence around them. There's a lot of people that have been trying to slander these great sources of energy and thus putting the planet at jeopardy. Forms of renewable energy might be solar wind. Geothermal waves, things like that. Another. Very. Non renewable, but will possibly be the solution to our energy prices is nuclear energy. Now there's a stigma around nuclear energy, whether if it's the. Issues that have happened in Japan or the issues that have happened in Russia, but there's a lot of evidence that shows that it is a very stable form. The technology shows it.",5.0
"If you look at a map of the world, chances are the. Countries. The size of them is going to be very misconstrued if you were to look at a globe that is a correct representation of the size of the country. It is hard to represent a 3D figure on a 2D space without these shapes and sizes being distorted. Thus is why. When if you were to take a globe and try to put it flat out, Greenland is going to look around. 4 to 500% bigger than what it actually is. If you were to take Greenland and bring it down to next to Africa, it would look like the size of Africa. However, it's barely the size of Texas. This has to do with a variety of different things, one when the original maps were created on A2 dimensional. Piece of paper. It was written by European explorers where it was biased towards the European and American Central area, and if you were to look at the map, it would look like the middle of the globe.",6.0

"Hey team. So here's the deal. Don't worry about anybody else that we're competing with. We're going to give you the one key. The one key item that we need to do as a team to build this IKEA desk and that is follow the instructions and the instructions might be a little complicated, but take your time with EMM. Read the visuals on the. On the IKEA instructions and just make sure you go one by one and make sure that you check off on each one is really easy with IKEA instructions to. Move a little too fast and put a piece in the wrong place. Or maybe not include a thing, but if you pay attention closely, it will guide you in the way that you need to go. So take your time, read the instructions and let's go. Have fun. Thanks.",4.0
"The employee that we talked about a few months ago that we put on a performance plan, um, after an initial kind of burst of um kind of performing better in being in the spot where they needed to be as falling back into kind of old habits, um. That they were that contribute signed their underperformance before. After some more conversations with this person, um, I'm feeling that it's time that we move on as an organization from. From employing them, which is really tough, I know that we we like this person and it's a situation that we not is not optimal or ideal but. The current contributions to the team and then historically what we've seen with this person. Will reflect the values that we have as a team and as as an organization. So at this time, I strongly recommend that we let this person go. Perhaps we look for opportunities to. Take care of them as we. As we let them go either through severance or help outside the organization. But at this time I strongly recommend that, um, we let this person go, so it's too bad. And we would like to um. Move forward in a positive way for the broader team and help them get in a spot where they can as a team perform better than they are currently. So thank you, hope you take care my recommendation and will talk further.",5.0
"So my boss is at the executive director level within my organization. Uhhh. I do not work directly on her team, um, and with her projects. So I sit on another line of business. I've worked with her in the past, but it's it's been a long time since we've worked directly together. Honestly, it actually worked out really well. She has a line of sight into the organization and our. Kind of department, if you will, in a way that I don't have so she can be my eyes and ears, that kind of a larger organizational level. Um. And I'm also able to kind of do that for her on the project and team that I'm on. So it actually works out really well. I think the only hiccup is that she's not in my day today or even close to it. So there's dynamics of like my current team both above me and below me that she doesn't understand everyday, but otherwise pretty good.",
"So right now my team is doing fantastic. They've adopted to um new client, a new brand, a new overall team within the organization and they've jumped in really with both feet and um have honestly excelled and provided a ton of value pretty much from day one. I've been keeping in really close contact that we as we've made this transition with my team members. Checking in on them, making sure that they have what they need. What questions do they have and how can I help them? Removing roadblocks, finding out information, whatever it may be to help them kind of with their day-to-day and their day-to-day, that helps me with the overall team as well. So right now, everybody's just doing really well and I'm proud of how they've transitioned into these new rules. The other thing is we're looking for those kind of future opportunities within this team. So we've got a project in front of us for the next few. Months. But um, what is after that that our team is going to dive into here and there? So not only just managing, are we managing like the day today and kind of the near future, but also just kind of having conversations about like what other opportunities would you like to have within this larger team that are going to help you with your career and the things that you want to do within this organization.

"My philosophy, I think. In a nutshell, is to be an enabler for folks that I manage. Um, either directly within a team and that can take. Shape in many different ways, and I think 1 as a direct report, I want to be there for somebody that wants to grow their career, be successful, take advantage of opportunities that are within the organization and see if they can be the best person they can within the workplace, organization, team, etc. And then from a team standpoint, also be that person that can be a mentor to folks at times, but also be somebody that. Helps unlock opportunities and even, you know, hopefully can remove roadblocks. Roadblocks from not only like a personal standpoint but also a management standpoint as well. So overall I hope to be an enabler for my teams.",5.0
"So I have two teams really. So I have a team that is my direct report, which is one person. And then I have a project team, which at times is actually different project teams, um, sometimes my direct report is on the team, other times that person is not. So for my direct report actually going to continue doing a lot of things that we have been doing for quite awhile as yours in fact, to make sure that we have good trust. With one another and that we are continuing our path of growth for like for both of us really not only is like a team but as individuals. So we will continue with regular checkins helping with that trust component open. Open policy for. Any issues, hopes, dreams, opportunities, you know things that may come up that my direct report would like to talk about or take advantage of. Um many different ways. And then always I'm always keeping a lookout or and I forward on growth opportunities for that person as well. Making sure that they're aligned with those types of opportunities, but also seeing things that they can't see sometimes just given the hierarchy at ah within the organization, so within. Um, project team um. The opportunities and plan is a little bit different. One, we're obviously moving towards the end of uh. We're moving towards a project and project goal and many of the folks that are on the team are not my direct reports and also might not even be. The folks that are within my same discipline. So I'll be working with folks that are in other disciplines that pull together that make the team for the project. So a lot of my efforts around that is, eh, establishing trust with that team from day one and continuing that all the way through being very clear about deadlines, expectations and then also being flexible within the project as things come up from either clients, things that are. Don't necessarily go as planned during the project, but also listening to my team on pulling in their expertise and their knowledge to affect ultimately what we do within the project. So being flexible within that, those are kind of I felt like a key recipe into making a pretty good project and not being overly authoritarian or. You know, kind of um. Stubborn if you will, about how a project should go, but really like laying out at least an initial plan and taking it from there through the end. So with that two different project plans for kind of two different scenarios. Thank you.",4.0
"For my 2 minute teach, I'm going to be teaching you guys how to play a friendly game of spit. Spit is a card game use very similar to solitaire or poker. You know, if you may have it, it's a game that brings a group of 2-3 or even four people together. Traditionally the game is played with two players. Two players each get about 7 cards. Now the goal or the purpose for this game is for each player to one finish the cars that they have in their hand. Two for the player to slap. The deck of cards that has the least amount of cards. The end result of the game? Is to be the first one out with no cards. Two ways that you could achieve this. Again it is by 1. Finishing the card that you have in your deck. And also two by slapping once you finish those cards, slapping the lowest card on the table. How you play this? Simply put it down if you have a 5 and I have a 3. And we both got to put the car down at the same time. The three is less than the five. So if I have a stack of 10 cards and you have a stack of 20 cards on the table, if we both put down our last card, you should be going to. Slap the card deck that has the least amount of cards. So let's run that back. We're playing, we're putting our cards down, were lining them up. There's a, there's a.",5.0
"I have always had a knack for helping others. Whether it was family, friends, strangers, people who you meet in everyday life. I've always had a knack for being able to assist and to help other people make their life easier, whatever way that is that I could do so. In my previous job, I worked as a sales associate for Best Buy and at the time I was working in our computer department. Being that I have a left for technology and helping people, I was pacing the computer department of course to sell computers, but not only to sell computers to help people find solutions to their technical issues that they didn't even know that they had. It was back to school time and um mother had came in with her daughter looking for a specific laptop. Working in retail, I'm gonna tell you a secret that then they don't broadcast. But sometimes we have inventory issues, so an app forces, for example, the Best Buy app could say that we have two laptops in stock when we really have 0. Sometimes the count could be up, it can fluctuate, it can increase or decrease. Its sporadic. So at that time the mother and daughter came, it was back to school time and they were looking for this specific laptop. Now, when I checked the system, our inventory system says that we don't have any of that computer, that laptop left in stock. I've checked neighboring stores, they didn't have any of those laptops in stock as well. So any normal employee would have told the customer, hey, we don't have the laptop in stock, um, we could place the order, it can reach you whenever it does, but I took the extra step to go up to our inventory. Room that we had and check to see if indeed we actually had the laptop. Long story short, we had the laptop and I was able to have the customer by it and they were able to get it for school. The moral of my story is sometimes it is essential to go above and beyond for your job, for the customers. If you're doing something or being asked to do something, give it your all.",6.0
"During back to school time at a previous job that I worked, we got a lot of customers who came into the store looking to grab last minute items. I specifically remember a time when it was back to school time and a mother and daughter entered into our store looking for a specific laptop. At the time it was a sales associate at Best Buy and I was working alongside. My other my other coworkers in the computer department. So a mother and daughter came in looking for a specific laptop that they had found online that they wanted. So, Long story short, we were able to. Locate the laptop they that they wanted, but at first the inventory app that we use in our store was incorrect. The mole of the story is that sometimes it is good to go above and beyond your requirements, whether it's for work or personal, in order to achieve the results that you want. So the apps folders that we didn't have any in stock, but because I took the extra step and effort we were able to. Achieve the goal which was getting a laptop for the mother and daughter.",
"An issue that I think that the world should be paying a lot more attention to is education, and not education by itself. How we are educating it could be children, teenagers, people in college, just people on a whole. I bet you if I ask you what's your first remembrance of being taught something or learning something, a lot of people might say my first. Um, lesson that I've learned. My first lesson that I've learned was being able to walk, or learning to say Mama or Dada, or learning your ABC's, or even learning to count. That can be some of the. Eh, lessons that we've learned and adapted as infants. And believe it or not, those and many lessons have been a stepping stone into how we learn are the level of our learning now. So I think that education and and the impact that it definitely has on everybody, whether you're young, your middle age, whether you're a bit older is still the central and that's something that the world should take more interest in. A simple fix could be creating more. Courses online for people for all ages, no matter what background you have, what level of education even that you guys have, it could be more schools, especially placed in low income areas throughout the globe. So simple things of that nature can definitely be impactful and. Beneficial to each and everybody across the globe, because the more knowledge you have is the more power that you do have. Also niche specific things as far as niche specific education, whether it's courses, whether it's like I said before, programs, building new schools, things that are specific to certain key skills that we should have to grow up. So I think education on a whole is something that the world needs to invest a little bit more in, not just for the youth sport for everybody.",6.0

"Throughout my experience here at IBM, one of the things I realized is that communication is very effective in terms of where you. Where and who you connect with in terms of your interest. For example, I'm interested in engineering. It took me a little while to meet different ibmers along the way during my. At least six weeks working here. I was able to meet. IBM is that work in design, work in marketing, working security. And through those connections I was able to meet people that worked in systems which they work on hardware engineering and they run different test on different computer machines furthermore. One of the things I would say is that. When trying to network with people, sometimes you should ask them questions. What it is that they do? How do they get their work done? What are some challenges that they faced? That way you show that you're not all about yourself, but you are actually trying to learn, and that you actually care about what it is that they have to say. What this does it distinguish you from the many other people that they meet on a daily basis, showing that one, not only. Are you trying to get somewhere by learning how they could connect you with other people, but that you also care about them? No one likes someone that is selfish and thus this way. By utilizing this skill and this technique you are able to better their relationship with people that you meet.",5.0
"I have worked for IBM for two internships and this one is a part of the IBM bridge program overall from my first experience. It went very smoothly, however, during my second internship, there were actually a few challenges along the way and a few hurdles that I had to try to climb over. When I did my second internship because I worked in IBM security, one of the problems that we had and we faced as a group, being a group of 10, was that we had a difficult time accessing that data that was in the spreadsheets. The internship experience is actually seven weeks long. During that internship we were not able to work on the project for actually. Three weeks. What this meant was finally when we got access to that database on week three, we had just about. Three weeks to work on the on the information and the clients database for IBM, but also we had to prepare a presentation at the same time. One of the things that I and some of the members of my teams actually suggested was that during the day we would work majority of our time on the project but leave at least one hour. But then the day when we come together as a group to work on the presentation overall, at the end of that experience, one of the things that we found out that we were able to do was to overcome this challenge, prepare presentation. Delivered successfully and not only do this, but we were able to. Get the work done.",6.0
"Cool. Overall, one of the things I would say is that when networking, we must try to figure out what it is that we're trying to. Gain or acquire by meeting that person. If they work in a particular department, what is something that you could learn from them? Or how is it that they could best connect you with the people that you would probably want to meet? For example, I did engineering, and because I did engineering, one of the things that I had to do was meet other people that were not in the engineering department and have them try to connect me with the people that. Worked in the engineering department. One of the things that happened to me was that I had to meet a designer, who then had to meet another designer, who then reached out to the people that worked in engineering. And overall that was a successful way in which I use different connections to meet and connect with something that was important to me.",
"Overall, one of the things that I believe there are a lot of people should at least have some knowledge on, or at least take a little bit of their time in their extra spread time to learn about. Would be the financial markets. Financial markets are completely. Difficult and hard to understand at first. But I believe that that comes with anything that happens in life. First, you're gonna receive a topic or skill or activity. That may be a little bit difficult, but once you continue to practice and give it your best, you will be able to acquire not only the knowledge, but you will now have the skills at which you are able to understand that topic. The reason why I believe that a lot of people should understand financial markets, even if you're not an investor, is because the financial markets actually have. Eh impact on our day-to-day life, which we do not really see until we start to learn about these things. For example, did you know that a lot of companies that have their business unit overseas? Pay very close attention to the financial markets in terms of currencies. For example, forex market. Why is this important? This is important because let's say a company does a certain amount of revenue in another country, but their home based country is in the United States. That money has to be transferred over into the United States for that value. And sometimes, because it's either if the value of that currency is up or down, that could be a negative or a lower balance than it was when that currency was overseas. So This is why a lot of people should learn about financial markets.",5.0

Then you branch out as you learn and try to create your own skill, your own strategy, and by doing so you will eventually become part of the 1% of people that are successful at trading.",6.0

It was Red Nose, pretty nice. It was all painted bumper doors. Everything was pain. I liked writing in it. And then there was this one time I was heading to work in the morning. Um. I asked my unfortunately there was a crash in front of me. Car started swerving everywhere. I crashed this person from the rear, my bumper guide completely destroyed. The radiator took some damage. The headlight God cracked a little. It was a pain to fix, but we got it done. And I remember we changed each other's insurance and all that stuff. But for me it was a challenge fixing up the radiator. We've got to change the whole part completely because it was leaking and the car needs coolant: It's basically what keeps the engine from overheating the fan, the radius and the central part for a car. And um, Amber, when I was taking out the radiator that was the easy part. But once I um put the new one, all the pipes were different sizes didn't fit into the radiator and I thought I got the wrong one and I didn't. That the whole thing was because there was a little. Brother thing, they had to take off and we figured out and we're like, oh, it all makes sense. So yeah. We went to AutoZone, we'd return the, and then we got another one and it was all because of that little rubber piece that we didn't know that we had to take off when you were like initially set it up to and put it to the car.

And everything was so confusing to me at first. I didn't know where everything was. They were going so fast. Like if the customer wanted Cheeseburger, he will put cheeseburger the customer, while Mcdouble had put on my devil. And everything was so confusing at first because I was so not ready for it. I wasn't trained that well. And then the manager told him to give me the headset because it was my turn to actually do the job. And then I remember the first person that I got. He had a big order with some complicated like things like specific details like extra ketchup, extra Mayo. And there I was, trying to figure out how to do it. I couldn't see the buttons on the screen. I was thinking like at least 5 minutes each order. I was stressing so much and at the same time I had to worry about the money, the register and everything else. And that's one of my biggest, worst experiences when McDonald's.

"So I have one direct report and she is someone hard considered to be a Rockstar very much. In both senses of the word. She is, um, newer to our team. She's been with us for almost a year, but it's her first job out of college. And so through this program it has taught me the importance of getting to know her history, both her family and you know what she's done in the past, work experience, wise. Education wise, getting to know what she's looking forward to better her goals and her dreams. And from that being able to analyze, you know, what her current situation is, what her skill sets are, what her areas for improvement are to help then drive toward those goals that she is wanting to achieve in the experiences that she's wanting to have. And so as far as my manager plan, we have big team KP eyes, some big projects we have going on such. As next year's Big brand campaign, we have a brand ID project that we're working on and we also have weekly competitive newsletters that my reporting is responsible for and that we send out every week. And so to help build toward all of those things, I. I would like to use strategies such as using the one-on-one time that we have scheduled together each week to teach and train her. You know, not just review the calendar and kind of the status of projects, but to use that to help, um, personal and career growth and development as well. I also want to find more opportunities to help instill confidence in her, help her to stretch. I found that's really when she shines, when she gets out of that comfort zone and it's given more responsibility. And, you know, I'm a bit more hands off. And so as part of my plan, I'd like to do that more as well and to check in regularly on goals to ensure that we're working toward them to recognize and celebrate the progress that she's making and see how each of these steps are building to the larger goals that we have as a team. And so I think recognizing those little things, both professionally and personally, you know, birthdays, little work accomplishments, things that have gone really well will also help boost morale. And keep our team climbing and working toward these goals, these team KP eyes that we have and um also reminding her that all of us playing important role on the team.

And with that baseline knowledge, she's able to do so much on her own. And take ownership of the tasks that are hers. I've really appreciated when bosses have been hands off let let me work my way and on my timeline, but knowing that there is available for questions or help or back up and so I would like to continue to emulate and use that as part of my manager plan as well.",6.0

She knows when to ask for help and to escalate things. And has been a really great member of the team for this past year. I have noticed though that is common in people who are new. She lacks some confident she gets it can get a little insecure and kind of locked on and want me to review more things than is necessary. And she can um sometimes get a little flustered um with things, but I think um growing that confidence and independence to be able to do more on her own and trust yourself, trust her gut is something that is very much um, workable, not something that. We're working on together something she's aware of, something I'm aware of, and I think that's something that will come with time with more experience. But she has so many great foundations to be an excellent account manager and really does contribute a lot to the team, so overall things are going very well.",
"Hey there. Um, I was wondering if I could actually have a difficult conversation with you. Would that be OK? Awesome. Um, yeah, if we could step into your office, that would be great. So I wanted to talk to you a little bit more about Bob on the team. I know Bob has been with us for um about a year now and you know Bob is, Bob is such a fun person. He really is. So um who drilled through around, I know you're you're close with him and he really brings the fun energy to the team. That said, we did have me and him, me and him have a conversation several months back about performance. Things were really starting to slip fall between the cracks. And start impacting the business, clients are noticing other departments working with or are feeling frustrated because of because of that. We had this, we had a conversation, I saw some improvement for the first week or so, but has since slid back into that same groove and. Well, you know, I, I do really enjoy Bob as a person as well. I think that it may not be the best fit for him or for us to keep him on our team. He would really excel, I think in this other department. I think it's a stronger interest of his um, but I do think we need to let him go from our team. I think that it is at the point where it's beginning to hurt business and um impact the rest of the team as well. And so I know that's challenging um since he's. A very likable person, but I think for his good and for our good and the good of the company, that is going to be our best route of action. And so my plan is to have that conversation with him this afternoon about, you know, telling him unfortunately having to let him him go. So I wanted to share that with you and see if you had any other thoughts or advice as I approach that with him.",5.0

"Alright team, it's almost go time. I'm very excited. We're going to do excellent here, but I think we should go in with a plan. Um, having clear roles and responsibilities will help everyone out. I think it'll help us be efficient and give us our best shot at winning this. And so, um, one of you will be in charge of reading the instructions and dictating that to everyone else. We're going to have someone who immediately is in charge of opening the box, getting all the different parts organized and laid out in a clear way. Um, usually they're labeled alphabetical.

"So I have one direct report and she is someone hard considered to be a Rockstar very much. In both senses of the word. She is, um, newer to our team. She's been with us for almost a year, but it's her first job out of college. And so through this program it has taught me the importance of getting to know her history, both her family and you know what she's done in the past, work experience, wise. Education wise, getting to know what she's looking forward to better her goals and her dreams. And from that being able to analyze, you know, what her current situation is, what her skill sets are, what her areas for improvement are to help then drive toward those goals that she is wanting to achieve in the experiences that she's wanting to have. And so as far as my manager plan, we have big team KP eyes, some big projects we have going on such. As next year's Big brand campaign, we have a brand ID project that we're working on and we also have weekly competitive newsletters that my reporting is responsible for and that we send out every week. And so to help build toward all of those things, I. I would like to use strategies such as using the one-on-one time that we have scheduled together each week to teach and train her. You know, not just review the calendar and kind of the status of projects, but to use that to help, um, personal and career growth and development as well. I also want to find more opportunities to help instill confidence in her, help her to stretch. I found that's really when she shines, when she gets out of that comfort zone and it's given more responsibility. And, you know, I'm a bit more hands off. And so as part of my plan, I'd like to do that more as well and to check in regularly on goals to ensure that we're working toward them to recognize and celebrate the progress that she's making and see how each of these steps are building to the larger goals that we have as a team. And so I think recognizing those little things, both professionally and personally, you know, birthdays, little work accomplishments, things that have gone really well will also help boost morale. And keep our team climbing and working toward these goals, these team KP eyes that we have and um also reminding her that all of us playing important role on the team. We have a pretty big account management team but we all play an important part in everyone's thoughts and perspectives are needed and valued and um therefore that is my manager plan.",4.0
"My overall management philosophy is to build the foundation and then to set them free with my reporting that I have now. In particular, she's new. And so I do want to teach, you know, the processes that we follow, why we follow them, what the larger purpose is, the why behind everything, so that she has a foundation and understanding, but then to encourage her to fly and take it from there that she's capable. And with that baseline knowledge, she's able to do so much on her own. And take ownership of the tasks that are hers. I've really appreciated when bosses have been hands off let let me work my way and on my timeline, but knowing that there is available for questions or help or back up and so I would like to continue to emulate and use that as part of my manager plan as well.",4.0
"So my team is small. As far as those who reports me, it's myself in my one direct report. But as far as how the team is, how things are going over, all things are going really well.

She knows when to ask for help and to escalate things. And has been a really great member of the team for this past year. I have noticed though that is common in people who are new. She lacks some confident she gets it can get a little insecure and kind of locked on and want me to review more things than is necessary. And she can um sometimes get a little flustered um with things, but I think um growing that confidence and independence to be able to do more on her own and trust yourself, trust her gut is something that is very much um, workable, not something that.

"My plan for my team really just comes down to implementing better processes this year. We don't have great systems in place currently and it makes it difficult for each member of my team to do their job and grow within their role. Having chatted with each member of my team, I know that they all have personal growth goals and opportunities that they want to take advantage of this year and by having better processes in place, they will have more time to attend trainings and learn more about those things and just grow. Additionally, so my team KP eyes are to launch our media plans on time if processes are in place. Not be a problem. We should be setting expectations across the board with other internal teams and have the resources we need in place to get those campaigns up and running. The second is to make sure our weekly pacing documents and regular reporting documents are filled out on time. Again, with process in place, that should be happening. And the third is to see growth across my team members and what they want to learn. So they each have a few specific courses they want to take and learn about, and I want to make sure that they have time to do those. I have a few strategies I'd like to put in place to make that happen. The first is to improve the functionality of our weekly status meetings and give each member of my team some chances to. You know, candidly say this is what I'm working on, this is what is coming up next week and these are the things I really need help on to make that happen and to do that in a laid back environment where they feel like they can ask for help and have a discussion and learn from other members of the team as well. The second is just to provide regular access to training opportunities. This is a priority across several members of my team, and I want to make sure they know what training opportunities they have within the media plant team and the larger team at BML Y&R. And then the third is to continue career path meetings for my direct reports. Make sure that they feel like they're having those conversations with myself and my boss on a regular basis in order to make sure those improvements are happening and have the improvement ideas in place. I would like to create tracking documents to help improve process on the client side as well and then really ask for the input of my team on, you know, checklist. How do they do things? How are they doing things you know that is helping them save time and how can other members of the team take advantage of their learnings as well, so creating a pooled knowledge space for everyone to collaborate better. At the end of the day, my hope is that by improving process and setting guidelines to do certain. Checkpoints within that, that we will be able to see growth across more team members, have more training in place and just be really more organized going into the next year.",7.0

So I want to be available. I want to be candid. I want to have those conversations with them, but I also want them to feel like they have the autonomy to grow and make decisions for the team on their own as well and provide feedback. Because everyone. Those things differently and everyone can learn from another way of working or just another way of learning another way of communicating, and so I want to provide an open environment to be able to do that.",7.0
"Overall, the team is doing really well. Angela is really a Rockstar superstar across the cutie line of business. She manages everything day-to-day, has great relations with clients and is really growing into her mentorship role and it's exciting to see her step into that and be excited. Sam is newer to the team, but he is really proving himself to be a Rockstar, delivering his assignments on time and. Just asking really smart questions and diving in and you know, leaning into those training opportunities that he says he wants to be a part of. So he's really falling through with his actions on what he's telling us he wants. In the last couple months, Bryce has also grown significantly. She's really turning into a superstar across the Tennessee team. She's earning that trust from the CEI team and is confident in her recommendations and what she's providing. Everyone has some room to grow, obviously, myself included, but I do feel like, you know, from those three we're really seeing a lot of growth. Maddie has had some hiccups in the last couple months, but is really showing her commitment, improvement in commitment to improvement across that time period, and we're excited to work with her and see her, you know, achieve those goals. She sat for the last 3060 and 90 days. So overall, that's great from my standpoint. I definitely could use some work on delegating a little bit better and you know, providing more of a mentorship role across the team.

"Charlie Irwin is my boss. He is a media director at VML INR and so he has a few different KPIs than our direct teams. So it's a little bit less of what he does is tide to client work. So he does want to make sure the clients across our teams are really happy with what we're providing them and what we're able to offer as their media agency. But he also wants to improve process and organization across all of the media teams at VML INR, help facilitate any new offerings and educate the team on what those are, whether that be. You know a programmatic desk and really make sure people are testing and using those offerings for their clients. And then for our team you know directly he wants to ensure that we're running smoothly, clients are happy, the teams are happy and that our teams are mentored and having growth opportunities as they like to have. So he does kind of a larger breath of things across the company, but it's definitely there for our team.",
"Hi Charlie. I wanted to sit down today and have a difficult conversation around Maddie's growth. I know we talked a couple months ago and helped her set some goals and we really did see some improvement from about here to here. But I've noticed in the past month she's really slid back down to even below where she was before and were, you know, having difficult time across the team getting the workload done since she's not able to perform at the level we would want or expect her to right now. Um, which I know is not wear any of us wanted to because she really is a great. Um, you know, a great friend and team member to a lot of individual members across the team. And unfortunately, at the end of the day, no matter how nice she is, we really need her to do her job. And I think given that we've had some difficult conversations directly with her and giving her some chances to improve and we're really not seeing that improvement consistently, then now we would need to have, you know, more serious permanent conversation around what does this mean for her to stay here because I think, you know, she's. Been here for eight months and is not fulfilling her job description. So how? Since we don't seem to be able to help her do that, I think we really need to have a larger conversation with each other and then maybe to HR and her around the fact that this may not be the best fit for her. This may not be a role she can complete.",5.0
"I would start by pulling out the pieces and sorting them and getting out the instructions, and then I would ask the team what their strengths are. Who could interpret the instructions the best? Who feels like they are the fastest or best actually physically putting the table together and going from there. Since I don't know what people might excel at, that's how I would approach it, is to give them a starting point to plan from and then allow them to have input, since I think that would be the best way for us to collaborate together and finish the table in, eh? Reasonable amount of time.",7.0
"My manager planned surrounds four people that I have directly reporting to me. One of those people is on the general Ledger team, three of those people around the accounts payable team. So this was a little bit of a difficult plan to put together to make sure I included everybody to get us all to the same mountain top since they're on different teams and they do different things. But what I mainly focused on is how do I keep them connected. And what is the best way that I can improve all of them and maybe use some of the same common denominators. So the strategies that I put in place are spending more time to get familiar with RIPS program, which is our accounts payable system where the invoices live and help mainstream clearing those out. We don't want old items getting in there and staying in there. The second piece of that would be to boost training to make them more efficient. We have different systems that we use and I think that training would be a big help. So that it doesn't slow them down and keeps them running efficiently, including Excel training which is a program that we use often. The third strategy I have is mainly one of the most important. I would like to carve out time to spend together to be better connected for a better working relationship. I think that will help us create a safe space, the psychological safety that we talked about in our manager training, and I think that's really the best way to go about doing that is by just spending time together and being connected. The KP eyes that I have in place for my team includes all four members even though they're on separate teams, one being that will only have current month invoices to clear up in our accounts payable I PS system. The second one being that I need people to own their reconciliations and process completing them without assistance or with limited assistance. That seems to be something that we really need to work on and making them more independent. And then just completing the Ascent 360 Excel training, I think that would be super helpful to them because we use Excel in all aspects of our jobs regardless of what team you're on. And I think that just helps and makes it more efficient. Some of the issues or blockers that we've run into, our payment inquiries, close deadlines, vendor followups, things that cause us to have to stop and pause what we're doing and maybe slowing down that efficiency. So I'd like to help with maybe mainstreaming that and getting people to operate on a more effective, efficient way. The three ideas that I have for my 5% improvement are completing the true Colors Workshop. I did that early on in my time here at VML and I think that that really helps us understand who we're working with and how to better work with them. And we know their personality so we know how to answer their questions or engage with EMM additional Excel training, which has been my theme throughout the whole thing. And then the third one would maybe be doing a team building thing once a month, like a lunch or coffee chat, just to help keep us. Connected and keep us all on the same page.",6.0
"When I think back to the management philosophy from the beginning of our training and now here several weeks later, I believe I'm going to stick with the same philosophy, but maybe just add a piece to that. I really think that being connected and spending time with your team is one of the most important things. Supporting them, letting them know that you care, making sure that they know you're supporting them and that you're there to help them along the way and creating that safe space is the most important thing to me. That's not something that I've had a lot. Along the way and after taking this training, I'm realizing how important that truly is. It's not always just about the business or making sure that everything is running smoothly in your day-to-day work, but making sure that you take time out to spend with each other and make sure that everybody is making the summit with you and that nobody is being left behind.",7.0
"I thought it would be good to just go for a coffee chat and talk about the things that we probably need to improve on or maybe some things that we need to shift around with our team. Lisa is doing a great job on the rush tracker, but I think there's a little bit of efficiency issues there. I think she's a little bit slower on pulling their reports looking for client payment. She's kind of here with efficiency and I think we need her to be more up here so that they run a little smoother. And I think that by doing the. Report improvements that we talked about with Rhea the other day that will really help. But overall I think she's doing a great job with Nina. She's taken on the rent invoices now and I have a feeling those are going to get much better since she's taking them from Angela. Angela has continued to make several mistakes month over month. Nina really pays attention to the detail and she makes sure that everything is perfectly in line and correct before it goes into the system, while there's a little bit of a weakness there where she does go a little slower. Because she's spending so much time in the details, I still think that on the rent invoices, it will be good for her to take that over because it's going to be more accurate and that's going to help Corey with the reconciliations. And I think overall, we're just going to see a good improvement there by her taking that over. But we can assess and keep an eye on how she's doing and then maybe shift it elsewhere if we think that it's not working out. With Susan, she still maintaining the inbox, keeping up with I PS, I've noticed that the production items are ratcheting down quite a bit, which means that she's getting those, moving, staying on top of those and doing a really great job with making sure that we don't have items, continuing to age and the inbox is cleared out at the end of every day, which is something that's new for us. We didn't have that before she started. Call still doing a great job with learning reconciliations, taking on some more and looking forward to getting more into audit.

"My boss is Mallory Seckman. She is one of two finance directors on the team and they report up to the controller. So they're part of leadership out of our whole department of 60 people. What she does in layman's terms is ensures that everyone stays on task, that we hit reporting deadlines timely and that people are doing things accurately. And she's recently been involved in a shift in the department, which I have also been involved with with her, and we are tasked with making sure that our accounts. Payable department as functioning more smoothly and we've been working on that together, which has given me the opportunity to learn a lot more about her. And what I'm realizing is she spends a lot more time actually engaging with people to make sure that people are doing what they're supposed to do and follow-ups versus actual tasks. So she's more of someone who delegates and follows up and just make sure that the herd stays where they're supposed to be and goes in the right direction versus actually accomplishing certain tasks day by day and not making sure that. She is doing that versus working with the whole team.",
"Hey, Mallory, I was wondering, do you have a few minutes to talk about something that's a little bit difficult to discuss, but I think it's something that we need to talk about. Um, Lisa, I know we had talked about a little while ago, maybe 2-3 weeks ago, going on a month now, um. And she wasn't performing super well in the beginning when we first took over and we had talked about how to improve and maybe just giving her a chance or do we let her go. And I think the consensus from Scott after you had talked to him and some of our other conversations was. We need to. Make sure that our teams running efficiently and so maybe she's not the right fit, but I think after spending some time with her and when I'm getting to know about her is being a contractor. A lot of times I think people just feel like they don't belong because they're part of the company, but they're not fully part of the company like they are when they come on as an FTE with benefits and being apart of all the things that we do, including the fun stuff and not just work. I think that's part of what the issue is with her. It seems the more time I spend with her and talk. Through tasks that she's going to own. And we talk about conversion dates and when she's really going to truly become a VML INR person. And it seems to really set off a light with her. And I see that she really just wants to be a part of the group and the team. And the more we talk through things, it seems she feels more like she has a sense of belonging. And she's actually said to me recently that she does want to be here. She loves working with us and that out of all the companies she's worked for, this is one of the best companies that she's ever worked for and she wants to stay here. I personally think that she's a great asset on our team. I think we just need to give her a little bit more time to work through things and evaluate her performance on a more regular basis and kind of letting her know where she is so that she's not wondering and so that we're also getting the full need from her role as what we need for the team as well.",7.0
"OK, team, I really want to win this. There's four of us and me included. So I think if we divide and conquer, we can really get the process going and we can effectively get this table put together and win this. We have four legs. We have a column of drawers and we have a glass top. I think if one of you works, I'm putting the four legs together and getting those attached to the table. Then one of you takes the column of drawers, gets ready to put those in, maybe assist with the legs so that that moves effectively. And then once we all get it done, two of us can pick up the glass top and carry it over and assemble it on the top, making sure that it's fixed and that it's not loose. Everything is tight and in place. And then we can ring the bell saying that our table is ready and hopefully we win this challenge. Anybody have any questions? OK, let's go.",7.0
"My manager planned surrounds four people that I have directly reporting to me. One of those people is on the general Ledger team, three of those people around the accounts payable team. So this was a little bit of a difficult plan to put together to make sure I included everybody to get us all to the same mountain top since they're on different teams and they do different things. But what I mainly focused on is how do I keep them connected. And what is the best way that I can improve all of them and maybe use some of the same common denominators. So the strategies that I put in place are spending more time to get familiar with RIPS program, which is our accounts payable system where the invoices live and help mainstream clearing those out. We don't want old items getting in there and staying in there. The second piece of that would be to boost training to make them more efficient. We have different systems that we use and I think that training would be a big help. So that it doesn't slow them down and keeps them running efficiently, including Excel training which is a program that we use often. The third strategy I have is mainly one of the most important. I would like to carve out time to spend together to be better connected for a better working relationship. I think that will help us create a safe space, the psychological safety that we talked about in our manager training, and I think that's really the best way to go about doing that is by just spending time together and being connected. The KP eyes that I have in place for my team includes all four members even though they're on separate teams, one being that will only have current month invoices to clear up in our accounts payable I PS system. The second one being that I need people to own their reconciliations and process completing them without assistance or with limited assistance. That seems to be something that we really need to work on and making them more independent. And then just completing the Ascent 360 Excel training, I think that would be super helpful to them because we use Excel in all aspects of our jobs regardless of what team you're on. And I think that just helps and makes it more efficient. Some of the issues or blockers that we've run into, our payment inquiries, close deadlines, vendor followups, things that cause us to have to stop and pause what we're doing and maybe slowing down that efficiency. So I'd like to help with maybe mainstreaming that and getting people to operate on a more effective, efficient way. The three ideas that I have for my 5% improvement are completing the true Colors Workshop. I did that early on in my time here at VML and I think that that really helps us understand who we're working with and how to better work with them. And we know their personality so we know how to answer their questions or engage with EMM additional Excel training, which has been my theme throughout the whole thing. And then the third one would maybe be doing a team building thing once a month, like a lunch or coffee chat, just to help keep us. Connected and keep us all on the same page.",5.0
"When I think back to the management philosophy from the beginning of our training and now here several weeks later, I believe I'm going to stick with the same philosophy, but maybe just add a piece to that. I really think that being connected and spending time with your team is one of the most important things. Supporting them, letting them know that you care, making sure that they know you're supporting them and that you're there to help them along the way and creating that safe space is the most important thing to me. That's not something that I've had a lot. Along the way and after taking this training, I'm realizing how important that truly is. It's not always just about the business or making sure that everything is running smoothly in your day-to-day work, but making sure that you take time out to spend with each other and make sure that everybody is making the summit with you and that nobody is being left behind.",6.0
"I thought it would be good to just go for a coffee chat and talk about the things that we probably need to improve on or maybe some things that we need to shift around with our team. Lisa is doing a great job on the rush tracker, but I think there's a little bit of efficiency issues there. I think she's a little bit slower on pulling their reports looking for client payment. She's kind of here with efficiency and I think we need her to be more up here so that they run a little smoother. And I think that by doing the. Report improvements that we talked about with Rhea the other day that will really help. But overall I think she's doing a great job with Nina. She's taken on the rent invoices now and I have a feeling those are going to get much better since she's taking them from Angela. Angela has continued to make several mistakes month over month. Nina really pays attention to the detail and she makes sure that everything is perfectly in line and correct before it goes into the system, while there's a little bit of a weakness there where she does go a little slower. Because she's spending so much time in the details, I still think that on the rent invoices, it will be good for her to take that over because it's going to be more accurate and that's going to help Corey with the reconciliations. And I think overall, we're just going to see a good improvement there by her taking that over. But we can assess and keep an eye on how she's doing and then maybe shift it elsewhere if we think that it's not working out. With Susan, she still maintaining the inbox, keeping up with I PS, I've noticed that the production items are ratcheting down quite a bit, which means that she's getting those, moving, staying on top of those and doing a really great job with making sure that we don't have items, continuing to age and the inbox is cleared out at the end of every day, which is something that's new for us.

"My team has really definitive structure. I have a senior, I have two connections managers and I have an associate connections manager, um, through this life hike and through kind of thinking about my plan for my team and also talking to them about their goals and their aspirations and the things that they want to accomplish in the next six months, the next year in their careers. Um, we're actually working through, it's a perfect time of year, it's early November. So starting next year as we transition into 2023 with our clients, 2023 planning, we're working through re kind of restructuring how our team functions for a couple reasons, eh, some certain teams teammates had specific feedback on things that they wanted to maybe doing a little bit better. Also I kind of see some opportunities to potentially push some of my teammates. Two of my teammates are in queue for promotion. And so that will kind of also change the dynamic of the team when that happens, which may not be until maybe this year, maybe next year. And so part of my plan here is to kind of try to reposition each of our teammates into just an even stronger and better place. They've all really stepped up a lot over the last couple years, specifically Matt, who's been are the team lead under me. He is going to continue to be able to step up into a more management role that continues to elevate him into the supervisor position throughout throughout all of next year. Um, for my 2 connections managers, they're both performing at a senior level already. And so we're working alongside Matt. I'm working with him to try to make sure we're really positioning both of them, not only to continue to step into the roles as they hopefully get promoted, but also continue to push them and make sure that they're taking more responsibility. They're stepping more into the strategy side of things. And then ask for my associate connection manager. She's fresh out of college. She's very new to the industry and to to our our. Jobs. And so right now she's really just being a sponge. And so I'm keeping in check with her, making sure she's feeling comfortable, making sure she's not too overwhelmed. And so after we kind of reposition a little bit of the work on the team in different places, the hope is to continue to stay close with them and also allow myself the ability to step out a little bit more, let them continue to run and continue to be successful. As I'm allowed to step in to hire more strategic conversations on the team. I really think the manager hike was really helpful to help me.

I don't want anyone to feel so overwhelmed that they burn out, right?

And the stick inappropriate moments. Matt really has been here almost just a little over a year in his roles as senior connections manager. He has really stepped up and really just done some incredible work to try to make sure that we're elevating the right stories to the clients, were telling the right stories in reporting. He's become really an invaluable member on the team. I can't wait to continue to see him to work and flex becoming more of a leader of some of our lower level people. As for Jordan, Andrew, they've also been here a little over a year and almost a year and a half now. Um, they both came in. They learned paid search, they learned United Rentals, they learn how to do the job and now are just flourishing. I don't have to worry about projects when I give it to them. I don't have to worry about if their job is going to get done or not. They always meet deadlines. If they don't meet deadlines there, immediately communicating and we're talking through how we can kind of adjust or how they can lean on me. And it's been really, really wonderful to see how strong that they've performed. Both of them are in queue for promotion and are already performing at the level above them. Natalie is an associate connections manager. She has been such a strong addition to the team. Her attention to detail has been so great. She is really eager to learn. She's excited about paid search, excited about the work we're doing um, chemistry wise, fits well with everyone and is able to riff but also be a strong member of the team and I feel so lucky to get to lead all four of these people every day.",

I think the thing with Valerie and one of the things that we talked through together is that. Um, you know, while she is doing such a great job of being boots on the ground and making sure that everyone is staff and everyone is comfortable. One of the things that I can lean and help her with as being future thinking, looking for opportunities for our team to grow, looking for future proofing the art department and our job within VM INR.

They're not communicating even when we over communicate and try to ask them to. I've even tried to kind of lean in and assist with projects and help with things. We did see things get better for a couple months and now they're right back to where they were and I just don't think they're a good fit for this company in this role. I know that we have invested a lot of time in them, but right now with where the team structure goes. The work is being divita other people, it's adding more workload onto everyone else instead of adding to the team. I think they're actually adding more work to the team instead of taking any workload off of any of us. As I'm future proofing and as I'm trying to think about where we think this team should go, knowing that we've tried multiple times to try to bring this employer around.

"Hi, I want to tell you a little bit about how to complete a knit stitch. This is a great stress reliever that I use on um traveling for work, when traveling for pleasure, but also is a great way to redirect some of that ADHD energy that we all have. So starting with the project I'm working on right now, I just want to show you very simply that you can place your right hand needle into a loop on your left needle, take your working yarn, loop it over your right needle. And then pull it through. There's actually an old old um phrase that they taught children that was um in through the front door, out round the back. Jump over the back door and out pops Jack. So that used to be something that they would use to teach children how to knit. And shockingly this used to be a very male dominated and child dominated skill set. But as you learn to knit, um, your speed increases. But like I'd like to show you again as you take your right hand needle, so this needle in your right hand and then you take it and you place it in the front of your left needle loop and then you take. Your working yarn, you rap it. Under and over. Catch it with your right needle. Pull it through the loop on your left needle and then slide that loop off and you've completed and it stitch. It looks really really hard but it's not. So let's try it one more time. So we take our right needle and we slip it through the front of our laughed the 1st loop on our left needle. We take our working yarn that's in our right hand. We work our yarn over. Like under and over the right hand stick, right hand needle, and then pull the yarn through the stitch. And you can see here that it's just about the stitch on your right needle listed in your left needle are connected. We slide it off and you've made a new loop.

"My favorite place to go on vacation or holiday, as our European colleagues call it, is a place called North Conway, NH it is a place that my husband and I have visited together for over 20 years and we say that every time we leave we live a little bit of our heart there. It is filled with mountains and lakes and rivers and the people are very friendly and the tourism is a little bit of a problem 'cause there's a lot of tourists, so you should choose when you go wisely. What I like about it is the slower pace. It allows me to slow down, drink a cup of coffee, really enjoy the scenery, go for a hike, go for a walk, take the dog into the woods, but also float on a lake is kind of my happy spot. I think everybody should enjoy the beautiful mountains of New Hampshire at least once in their life, and perhaps maybe once a week, once a year, or for a week every year for the last 20 years of their life like I have.

Something I think that we could work on a little bit better is um. Not um is kind of around how we meet in person. I think that we have some expectations of having these in person and hybrid meetings that aren't always super effective to the people online and that makes it pretty difficult.

"Hi, I'm Kate Crosby, and I'd like to tell you a little bit about how I became a program manager here at Millipore Sigma. I started my career in 1999 when I graduated with my bachelors degree and I headed off to Harvard. Sounds fancy, right? Not as fancy as you think. I started off as a lab technician in the first gene therapy laboratory on the East Coast of the United States. It was an exciting time to be in biotech, especially in Gene. Therapy. I worked at Harvard for several years, um, developing my skills and building my toolbox as a lab technician. I then moved on to another academic institution here in the Greater Boston area, Tuftsin, focused on diabetes research, primarily looking at biologics for treating type 2 diabetes. As I moved through my scientific career, I took different steps in each step took me a little bit in a different path. I was really interested in protein purification and robotics, so that led me into different areas of learning about technologies, instrumentation and also new methods approaching verification. As I developed those skills, then I started to be more interested in, well, what makes the AH says that show the protein purification has been successful. So we started to work into asset development. I ended my scientific career with a few publications, a whole bunch patents and a lot of experience. One of the drugs I worked on when I was at Tufts is currently a drug on the market for treating type 2 diabetes. Is very profitable and helping a lot of patience. One of the things that is very interesting to me is that now after 20 plus years of being in biotech, I have full circle back to my first job at Harvard. I'm working as a gene therapy program manager here at Millipore Sigma. I did take a big jump from working as a lab bench scientist to scientific marketing. Now that was really important because I was laid off from one of our competitors in 2008 and that led me. Yeah.",7.0
"Hello everybody. Today I want to talk about requirements engineering and why it's so important for the software development process. When I started at she additive in 2017, we didn't have a requirement engineer in our team. Back then it was very difficult to ride and document requirements. It was a very tedious and time costly process. But today and especially during the last 12 months, we focused on integrating requirement engineers in our team. And now I want to tell you how that improved our process. One thing for example. Is that a requirement engineer is an expert which uses a standardized language to describe and define the requirements. For example, the word shall means that something is not an option, it's a must have. So with this technique we avoid misunderstandings. Another thing is that requirement engineers use dedicated tools to document their requirements. And those tools have additional features, for example versioning. Versioning is very important because with a certain software version we also need a corresponding version of the requirements. Um, doing this with Excel or word? It's very difficult. Another feature is the review process if you want to fix. A certain requirement you need a formal review and a technical review. For the formula review you need another requirement engineer, and for the technical review you need, for example, a systems engineer or a software developer. All in all, this improved our process a lot, er, much faster. Now we do less errors because we have more reviews. And yeah, that's it. Thank you very much.",6.0
"Hello everybody. Today I want to talk about playing table tennis. So what do you need to play table tennis? Of course you need a table tennis table with Annette with which divides the table into your half of the table and and into the opponents half. Then you need a white table tennis ball and a table tennis record. This record has two sides and each side need a different color. And of course you need. Sports clothing. So what is table tennis all about? Table tennis is all about hitting the ball into the other half of the table to the opponents half of the table. And if you miss the table, your opponent scores a point. The first player who has at least 11 points and leads with two points wins the game. This mean means you can win the game worth 11 to 9 or 12 to 10, but not worth 11 to 10. And if you want to win a whole table tennis match, you have to win three or five table tennis games. So how do you start a rally? To start really you have to go through certain move, it's called. The surf. The serving player has to put the ball onto his palm and then throw the ball at least 15 centimeters up there. When the ball falls back down, the players allowed to hit the ball and the ball must hit at first his side of the field and jumps over the net and has to hit the other side of the field and the opponent is allowed to hit the ball back into your field. So I want to add two more rules. It's not allowed to wear white shirts and it's not allowed to touch. The table tennis table with your hand, thank you very much and have fun playing table tennis.",5.0

"So when I started my career, I'd always wanted to go into some sort of engineering. I, um. Type role math and science was always a big interest for me. And when I first got out of college, I studied mechanical engineering and I found my first job. Um. In Florida, after applying all throughout the Midwest, I thought that's where I was going to be starting, starting my career in settling down. But yeah, out of one out of 50 jobs, I found myself in Florida and in an aerospace company. And I had never thought about going into aerospace at that point. But I happen to love it, being able to see. Planes move down the line to get to the flight line and there was something that they're really interested me, um. So I moved around a couple jobs, always within the aerospace industry, like in a mechanical engineering roll and move from Florida to California. And then after about five years doing that, I figured it was going to be time to move back. Closer to home, um. So I ended up staying and. Aerospace engineering position and I found myself in with GE UM. So it's a much different area, but I would never have tried to go into aerospace if I hadn't originally done that for my first entry level position. But I happen to love it and that's why where I am where I am now.",5.0
"So my favorite sport is tennis. So I'm going to be explaining how to play tennis now. First, you have to know the rules. So there was a court that's 78 feet long, 27 feet wide, 36 feet if you include the double s alleys. And then there's a net in the middle of that, um, which ranges from 3 feet high in the middle to 3 1/2 feet high on the outsides. Now, everyone. Every player has a racket and you have to have the balls and special tennis shoes also, but the rackets, the main, the main part that you need now. For the score in you have to win six games in a set and then two out of three sets, first two sets. Now to win a game you have to win four points or win by two, so it could. Could end up being far five to three um, the score point total for that game. Just as long as you're winning by two, scoring goes by 15. 3040 then game um. So yeah, six games to win a set, or seven if it's not win by two can be returned. Now to start the match you have to either start with a coin flip or flip your racket and have the your opponent gas. For example, if it's a nemora W for Wilford Wilson, it will have a W on its on its cap and you have a player asked to guess. Single coin flip concept. So main types of shots are groundstrokes which include forehands and backhands, volleys, serves and returns. Now server returned or serves the ball into the deep diagonal box and the returner has to has to hit it back anywhere in the court and that the point starts from there after each game then you will be able to the return or will switch to serving and you will just repeat that um. Until you finish your your games and set game set and match.",5.0

"Alright, I'd like to present my management plan, but before I get into it, I would like to give you a little background into my team. So um, the PR team for VM, Y&R is relatively new. In 2020 we got a new client and we had to staff up for that. So we did a lot of hiring and then we had a lot of quick turnover. So I became a manager in January of 2022 and immediately had to hire for additional people. Oh, I'm sorry, five additional people for our team. They are all very young and pretty and experience. So I've had that challenge. So I'll start out with our strategies and um, I've identified 3. The first one being identifying professional development opportunities for myself and my team. I think that is critical to their growth and to the success of our team. The second strategy is generating new business leads that is just to ensure that we continue to grow our PR team. And we give new opportunities for our employees to work on other clients. And then the third strategy is really just continuing to build trust and connection with my team because they are have all been here between 6:00 and nine months. So we are relatively young. My team, KP eyes are increasing our media impressions for our client year over year. Um, a big part of what we do is media relations and I want to ensure that we are delivering better results each year in getting getting better. The second KPI is receiving approval and recognition of our reporting metrics. Reporting is crucial. Data is crucial for PR to really prove our worth and so we need to get some clear direction on the reporting style. And what our client is looking for, the third KPI is engaging our team to find 10 new business leads. That's a goal that I have set forth so that we can grow our business. So two process KP eyes I have are scheduling a meeting with client leadership to review reporting I can't make um. Uh, I can't meet their expectations if I don't know what they are. The second process, KPI is creating a new business outreach template so that I can engage our team and new business. It's a great opportunity for them to improve their presentation and public speaking skills. Um, some improvement ideas they have are attending for professional development events per year, writing workshop, and finding a young professionals group at BML. One blocker than I've identified is just time. Because client day-to-day work is most important. So trying to make time for this and then my calendar is really just, eh. I've got a mix of professional development opportunities, writing workshops, um sprinkled in with some celebratory events, and really acknowledging and rewarding them for their hard work.",4.0

My loyalty lies within the person and not the company, so that could mean determining a particular if a particular role is the best fit. For this person and just always supporting their needs above the company, constantly striving for improvement as the last one. And that is really just, um, modeling that behavior.

I um, as you know, we have a young group and I'm definitely seeing some really great high performers on our team. And as we've discussed previously, I have a couple low performers. I really think it's going to be crucial this next year to identify some professional development opportunities. I feel like the team could really use some public relations industry webinars and just overall knowledge, um, I think that there's some work that can be done with some writing workshops and I really just want to make sure that I am dedicating time to um, soliciting those opportunities for the team and really making sure that they are taking advantage of them. At the same time I've spent the last year. Probably nine months really focused on one of our low performers and I just don't think that that's the best use of my time. We have a few high performers that I really want to. Spend more time really cultivating their skills and giving them the the feedback and the acknowledgement so that they stick around with us for a long time. And right now I just don't have the capabilities to do that. So I want to shift some priorities next year so that we're placing more emphasis on on the high performers on my team. But overall, I feel really good about where we're headed. I think we have a young group of of women who are excited to be here or in R wanting to. Um, just really improve their their industry knowledge for agriculture and public relations and I just want to be the best leader and support system for that team.",
"My boss is Adam Woolard, he is a managing director, um, his primary role is to um obviously lead our PR team, but I would say based on my perception about 85% of his time is dedicated to new business opportunities and trying to bring in new clients for our team.

He will tell you that his job is to give us the resources and the tools that we need and then get out of the way. He has a lot of trust in our team and um, he sees his role as somebody that is there to champion us and to support us and give us everything we need to do great work and he has been a great asset to our team and he just started in February of last year, so he is relatively new.",
"Hi, Adam, um, thank you for taking the time to meet with me. I want to have a difficult conversation with you. Would that be OK? Great. Um, so I know that we had a conversation with Jasmine a couple weeks ago about her performance, and immediately after that I did see some improvement in her communication and she was meeting deadlines. But unfortunately over the last week or two I've really noticed in another sharp decline in her performance. I just don't feel like she is. Capable of doing this type of work. She is not holding herself accountable when she makes mistakes. She is letting things slip through the cracks. She's very difficult in terms of being very combative. When I try and help her with her time management and her workload. I just don't see her really contributing much to this company and I also am concerned by the amount of time that I'm spending on her. And because she is a low performer, I just don't feel like my time is best spent there. There are other people on our team that I would really like to focus on. And um, and she is and she is not one of them. And so I've come to the realization that I think it's time that she look elsewhere for a job and that we unfortunately have to let her go. And um, I hope I've given you enough supporting reasons as to why I have come to that decision, but I think it's critical for our team. Success and for her own personal success at two-part ways and have her look for a new opportunity somewhere else.

Um, we're actually working through, it's a perfect time of year, it's early November. So starting next year as we transition into 2023 with our clients, 2023 planning, we're working through re kind of restructuring how our team functions for a couple reasons, eh, some certain teams teammates had specific feedback on things that they wanted to maybe doing a little bit better. Also I kind of see some opportunities to potentially push some of my teammates. Two of my teammates are in queue for promotion. And so that will kind of also change the dynamic of the team when that happens, which may not be until maybe this year, maybe next year. And so part of my plan here is to kind of try to reposition each of our teammates into just an even stronger and better place. They've all really stepped up a lot over the last couple years, specifically Matt, who's been are the team lead under me. He is going to continue to be able to step up into a more management role that continues to elevate him into the supervisor position throughout throughout all of next year. Um, for my 2 connections managers, they're both performing at a senior level already. And so we're working alongside Matt. I'm working with him to try to make sure we're really positioning both of them, not only to continue to step into the roles as they hopefully get promoted, but also continue to push them and make sure that they're taking more responsibility. They're stepping more into the strategy side of things. And then ask for my associate connection manager. She's fresh out of college. She's very new to the industry and to to our our. Jobs. And so right now she's really just being a sponge. And so I'm keeping in check with her, making sure she's feeling comfortable, making sure she's not too overwhelmed. And so after we kind of reposition a little bit of the work on the team in different places, the hope is to continue to stay close with them and also allow myself the ability to step out a little bit more, let them continue to run and continue to be successful. As I'm allowed to step in to hire more strategic conversations on the team. I really think the manager hike was really helpful to help me.

I don't want anyone to feel so overwhelmed that they burn out, right?

And the stick inappropriate moments. Matt really has been here almost just a little over a year in his roles as senior connections manager. He has really stepped up and really just done some incredible work to try to make sure that we're elevating the right stories to the clients, were telling the right stories in reporting. He's become really an invaluable member on the team. I can't wait to continue to see him to work and flex becoming more of a leader of some of our lower level people. As for Jordan, Andrew, they've also been here a little over a year and almost a year and a half now. Um, they both came in. They learned paid search, they learned United Rentals, they learn how to do the job and now are just flourishing. I don't have to worry about projects when I give it to them. I don't have to worry about if their job is going to get done or not. They always meet deadlines. If they don't meet deadlines there, immediately communicating and we're talking through how we can kind of adjust or how they can lean on me. And it's been really, really wonderful to see how strong that they've performed. Both of them are in queue for promotion and are already performing at the level above them. Natalie is an associate connections manager. She has been such a strong addition to the team. Her attention to detail has been so great. She is really eager to learn.

I think the thing with Valerie and one of the things that we talked through together is that. Um, you know, while she is doing such a great job of being boots on the ground and making sure that everyone is staff and everyone is comfortable. One of the things that I can lean and help her with as being future thinking, looking for opportunities for our team to grow, looking for future proofing the art department and our job within VM INR.

They're not communicating even when we over communicate and try to ask them to. I've even tried to kind of lean in and assist with projects and help with things. We did see things get better for a couple months and now they're right back to where they were and I just don't think they're a good fit for this company in this role. I know that we have invested a lot of time in them, but right now with where the team structure goes. The work is being divita other people, it's adding more workload onto everyone else instead of adding to the team.

So my goal is to build a new team and to start from the ground up and retain them for over a year. And to do this, it really requires us over delivering on whatever scope of work we sign with any of these five businesses. And then internally it's about getting buy in from any of the people that I'm direct reporting, um.

And it's actually taking on the roles and responsibilities of see in many ways and engaging these clients without my supervision, which has been really key clearing up my time. Personally, she came from a background of another market agency, so she does have experience, so I do believe that. She's one of the people that we are seeing as a potential future Rockstar around the organization and has the potential for high growth as we give her more responsibility.

There are portions of the scope that are being missed and I'm starting to think that the clients are noticing underperformance is occurring, which is a big problem. I believe that retaining him further is not just going to lead to poor morale within our team, but also within departments outside of us such as account and creative that he works with day. Today they are picking up the slack and if we continue, uh. Burden to occur, we'll have burnout across multiple teams and given that and the combination of client visibility, I believe it's time that we need to start making the hard decision of linium go. I know this has to go up internally, but I don't think an additional performance improvement plan will make any difference. So please let me know how we should move forward if I need to take a different approach to this. I've tried coaching EMM, tried showcasing, but it doesn't seem to be progressing any further. And. I I believe that. It will be for the best of the company if if we are able to. Make this change as soon as possible.

I mean you can only play when the conditions or the weather suits the suits the. Port um. So basically whoever chooses to bat or ball, the team that chooses to bowl will have all the 11 players on the field and the the opening team will have just two players who would be batting on each sides. So there is usually a bowler uhhh wicketkeeper who stands behind the batsman catching the ball and you have UH-2 empire. One is by the wicked and the other one is by the left side of the person who is trying to. Play the game. Um, there is a bowler who will build the ball, and the batsman is all that the batsman has to do. Is more like a baseball where you have to look at the ball and swing it as it goes up. Somebody catches it. There is a boundary line. If you're caught within the boundary line, you're out. Or else it it goes to the boundary which is 4 or it goes over the line that would be a sex. Sex runs that you get home runs. So that's how it is played. When all the 10 wickets are each time each team will have 10 wickets to bat. And when all the 10 wickets are gone then you lose.

"Good morning. As I plan out my manager plan for 2023, I first have to realize what is working for 2022, what is broken and how we can just shift moving forward. I have to think about strategies. Key performance indicators, my blockers, and then what my improvement ideas can be. And so in thinking about the strategies, I think about building better pipelines and better communication across the board, which is always important, um, with the team, with the immediate team and with the overall team. Thinking about how we like to feel rolls faster, but effectively not to just get individuals in seats. But to make sure they had they are the right people for the team and for the agency. Thinking about our KP eyes, the candidate pipeline growth, thinking about the blockers, what is slowing us down, what is hindering us, what is keeping us from moving faster with filling some of these roles. One of the things that I thought about was. The approval process and the time that it takes on the back end when you're ready to move forward with the candidate. Thinking about um, improvement ideas, 5% improvement ideas. So time management, how important is that? How we navigating that space? Um better follow up and follow through with the candidates. There are times when there is a delay, no matter what the delay maybe. How are we following through with the candidates? Are we sending emails? Are we getting on phone calls? Are we taking too long to follow up and just letting the candidates it by the wayside? What are we doing to? Help that along. And then one of the other things that can definitely be improved is properly closing um, new hire requisitions once they are field, once we have a candidate ready to go, we've gotten all the approvals that sometimes hold us up in the blocking process. What are we doing to make sure that that's close so it's not sitting there, so additional candidates are not applying to those roles when it has already been filled and then a team, um, key performance indicators, candidate growth, team structure. Candidate role success rates. I've also worked on my calendar. Um not every month, but the months that are most important.

But holding the team back and what other individuals need to step into place to pick up the workload? And what that looks like.

How can I help them move forward differently? Um, how could I help them?

So how I arrived at GE, um actually grew up on the east side of the state in Michigan my whole life and met my wife there, though, and we got married and she's from the West side of the state. And um. Uh ended up agreeing to move to this side of the state only if I found a job on this side of the state and GE Aviation and Grand Rapids. Um was hiring and short Long story short, I was hired in with GE, so I've been working on the windshield team ever since. As a Java developer and um before before GE I was also a Java developer but I was um a full stack Java developer where basically you handle everything from front end to back end, everything in between. But since being at GE I am a full time wind chill developer which is um on the PM space. So hopefully that was a good description. Thank you. Oh, I guess I need to keep going 'cause it needs to be a certain length. So, um, my previous experiences before GE, Um worked for a very small startup company. That was how I got my foot in the door to be a programmer. And um, I spent most of my career there. Until working for Archway Marketing Services, which was the last company I worked for before coming to GE. So that fills in the gaps I guess. So that's it. Thanks.",3.0
"Alright, I'd like to present my management plan, but before I get into it, I would like to give you a little background into my team. So um, the PR team for VM, Y&R is relatively new. In 2020 we got a new client and we had to staff up for that. So we did a lot of hiring and then we had a lot of quick turnover. So I became a manager in January of 2022 and immediately had to hire for additional people. Oh, I'm sorry, five additional people for our team. They are all very young and pretty and experience. So I've had that challenge. So I'll start out with our strategies and um, I've identified 3. The first one being identifying professional development opportunities for myself and my team. I think that is critical to their growth and to the success of our team. The second strategy is generating new business leads that is just to ensure that we continue to grow our PR team. And we give new opportunities for our employees to work on other clients. And then the third strategy is really just continuing to build trust and connection with my team because they are have all been here between 6:00 and nine months. So we are relatively young. My team, KP eyes are increasing our media impressions for our client year over year. Um, a big part of what we do is media relations and I want to ensure that we are delivering better results each year in getting getting better. The second KPI is receiving approval and recognition of our reporting metrics. Reporting is crucial. Data is crucial for PR to really prove our worth and so we need to get some clear direction on the reporting style. And what our client is looking for, the third KPI is engaging our team to find 10 new business leads. That's a goal that I have set forth so that we can grow our business. So two process KP eyes I have are scheduling a meeting with client leadership to review reporting I can't make um. Uh, I can't meet their expectations if I don't know what they are. The second process, KPI is creating a new business outreach template so that I can engage our team and new business. It's a great opportunity for them to improve their presentation and public speaking skills. Um, some improvement ideas they have are attending for professional development events per year, writing workshop, and finding a young professionals group at BML. One blocker than I've identified is just time. Because client day-to-day work is most important. So trying to make time for this and then my calendar is really just, eh. I've got a mix of professional development opportunities, writing workshops, um sprinkled in with some celebratory events, and really acknowledging and rewarding them for their hard work.",5.0
"I've identified 3 things that fall under my management philosophy. The first one is really crucial and it's accountability for the mistakes that we make within our team and even myself as a leader especially. No one is above making mistakes, no one is above making amends and finding solutions is is critical to the success of this position. My loyalty lies within the person and not the company, so that could mean determining a particular if a particular role is the best fit. For this person and just always supporting their needs above the company, constantly striving for improvement as the last one. And that is really just, um, modeling that behavior. And so when my team members see me always, um, you know, striving to learn more and educate myself, I think that they will follow suit and we will all be better for it.",5.0
"Hey, Adam, I want to take some time, um, while we're having coffee to talk a little bit about the team. I um, as you know, we have a young group and I'm definitely seeing some really great high performers on our team. And as we've discussed previously, I have a couple low performers. I really think it's going to be crucial this next year to identify some professional development opportunities. I feel like the team could really use some public relations industry webinars and just overall knowledge, um, I think that there's some work that can be done with some writing workshops and I really just want to make sure that I am dedicating time to um, soliciting those opportunities for the team and really making sure that they are taking advantage of them. At the same time I've spent the last year. Probably nine months really focused on one of our low performers and I just don't think that that's the best use of my time. We have a few high performers that I really want to. Spend more time really cultivating their skills and giving them the the feedback and the acknowledgement so that they stick around with us for a long time. And right now I just don't have the capabilities to do that. So I want to shift some priorities next year so that we're placing more emphasis on on the high performers on my team. But overall, I feel really good about where we're headed. I think we have a young group of of women who are excited to be here or in R wanting to. Um, just really improve their their industry knowledge for agriculture and public relations and I just want to be the best leader and support system for that team.",
"My boss is Adam Woolard, he is a managing director, um, his primary role is to um obviously lead our PR team, but I would say based on my perception about 85% of his time is dedicated to new business opportunities and trying to bring in new clients for our team. He is also eh, just big champion of our department and looking to get more opportunities for us. He will tell you that his job is to give us the resources and the tools that we need and then get out of the way. He has a lot of trust in our team and um, he sees his role as somebody that is there to champion us and to support us and give us everything we need to do great work and he has been a great asset to our team and he just started in February of last year, so he is relatively new.",
"Hi, Adam, um, thank you for taking the time to meet with me. I want to have a difficult conversation with you. Would that be OK? Great. Um, so I know that we had a conversation with Jasmine a couple weeks ago about her performance, and immediately after that I did see some improvement in her communication and she was meeting deadlines. But unfortunately over the last week or two I've really noticed in another sharp decline in her performance. I just don't feel like she is. Capable of doing this type of work. She is not holding herself accountable when she makes mistakes. She is letting things slip through the cracks. She's very difficult in terms of being very combative. When I try and help her with her time management and her workload. I just don't see her really contributing much to this company and I also am concerned by the amount of time that I'm spending on her. And because she is a low performer, I just don't feel like my time is best spent there. There are other people on our team that I would really like to focus on. And um, and she is and she is not one of them. And so I've come to the realization that I think it's time that she look elsewhere for a job and that we unfortunately have to let her go. And um, I hope I've given you enough supporting reasons as to why I have come to that decision, but I think it's critical for our team. Success and for her own personal success at two-part ways and have her look for a new opportunity somewhere else. And so I would like to move forward with the decision to let her go in the next few weeks if you would be OK with that.",4.0

So that's just, you know, numbers that I'm throwing out. But I mean, put that in perspective, that's a lot of trash. And we wonder why. You know, the plants and everything or just filled up and there's trash everywhere and the oceans, um, just all across the globe. I see people throwing out trash all the time. I am not one that does that in the street. But one thing I don't do is recycle. And I could get better about that just because statistically speaking, if we all continue to do that, where is the trash going to go in my backyard? So looking at the data and looking at, um, you know, thinking about one person times 4 pounds of trash and that's just for people that have £4.00. So people have over. That's the average.

So I work from home and I'm considering maybe trying to get back in the office a little bit. I just feel like. Or a lot of our team is actually remote and so trying to bring us all together in some way. So more often than I've never met some of my team members. So that's one thing that I feel like could change within our team and just um. You know, having that time together is really important and really knowing each other on a more personal level.

So any kind of sauce, any kind of marinara sauce that you would like to use and just kind of mix that in with your marinara or with your ground Chuck and all of your seasoning. So I prefer garlic um. Salt, pepper, a little bit of onion. So any kind of seasonings that you're partial to, you can go ahead and throw those in there. Mix all that up with your ground Chuck. Boil your noodles.

"Good morning. As I plan out my manager plan for 2023, I first have to realize what is working for 2022, what is broken and how we can just shift moving forward. I have to think about strategies. Key performance indicators, my blockers, and then what my improvement ideas can be. And so in thinking about the strategies, I think about building better pipelines and better communication across the board, which is always important, um, with the team, with the immediate team and with the overall team. Thinking about how we like to feel rolls faster, but effectively not to just get individuals in seats. But to make sure they had they are the right people for the team and for the agency. Thinking about our KP eyes, the candidate pipeline growth, thinking about the blockers, what is slowing us down, what is hindering us, what is keeping us from moving faster with filling some of these roles. One of the things that I thought about was. The approval process and the time that it takes on the back end when you're ready to move forward with the candidate. Thinking about um, improvement ideas, 5% improvement ideas. So time management, how important is that? How we navigating that space? Um better follow up and follow through with the candidates. There are times when there is a delay, no matter what the delay maybe. How are we following through with the candidates? Are we sending emails? Are we getting on phone calls? Are we taking too long to follow up and just letting the candidates it by the wayside? What are we doing to? Help that along. And then one of the other things that can definitely be improved is properly closing um, new hire requisitions once they are field, once we have a candidate ready to go, we've gotten all the approvals that sometimes hold us up in the blocking process. What are we doing to make sure that that's close so it's not sitting there, so additional candidates are not applying to those roles when it has already been filled and then a team, um, key performance indicators, candidate growth, team structure. Candidate role success rates. I've also worked on my calendar. Um not every month, but the months that are most important. So there is January 1st and foremost and so overviewing, forecasting UM 202023 plans with the team confirming um how things are aligned and so on.

As you know, she is the top recruiter across all the recruiters for filling roles in 2022 and I can't take credit for that. Yes, I hired her um, but I am only as strong as my team is and so having those tough communications or those tough conversations, I should I should say, with um, with candidates, with hiring managers, um learning how to speak up more and learning how to say no. I think she had that under control. I think the only shortfall is, um, learning how to accept the. Great job. Not that she doesn't accept it, but it's almost like she shies away from it. But just sharing that Oh my God, you're doing such a great job. You're killing it. You're doing all the amazing things. Um, just learning how to properly prepare for the difficult conversations a little bit. She doesn't quite shy away from that. Um, just a pinch hesitant, a little hesitation there and so just trying to figure out what the transition looks like and how to help her better with that. But besides that, both of my teammates are great. They definitely help me lead and carry the team on to do bigger and better things within recruiting.",
"My boss is Kimberly Spencer. She is the group talent director UM for VAYNR. As we just we just call her the group director of the team she leads the team there about. They're about 35 of us, give or take. At one point there was well over 40. Kim is a pretty good communicator. There are sometimes when she misses the mark a little bit, but she's very open and receptive to hearing. What we bring to the table and how those things could shift and or be better. She is great at making sure we all have our assignments and tasks across the board. She is really great at um. Our weekly meetings, weekly team meetings, in the meeting with us every other week individually. Um for our needs and concerns. The one thing that I would ask or would like of um Kim is response time. Sometimes it's not as fast as we'd like, but other than that everything is great.",
"Hi Kim, I know we have chatted about this employee in the past and um where they are lacking and not properly performing. Underperforming um within the team had a conversation and they definitely stepped up to the plate for a few weeks and they went back to their same habits where they are not helping to lead the team and upward manner. But holding the team back and what other individuals need to step into place to pick up the workload? And what that looks like. And so they are not helping the team and I know you have been excited for them or rooting for them, but I think because what you see on the outside, you don't get on the inside. I've had those difficult conversations. I have been a leader. I had been a support. I have asked what they needed, what's missing, how can I help them, um, prepare differently. How can I help them move forward differently? Um, how could I help them? With their roles as their problem with their sourcing habits and or um systems they are using, and so because I've had the conversation more than once because they turned it around for 2.5 seconds and then they shipped it back into their old habits. It's not effective for the team it's bringing down bringing down the team morale, let's bring it down a sense of just oneness unity together and so unfortunately I'm going to have to make the difficult decision. To move forward without them and remove them from this role and in turn find somebody else. And so have a conversation. And I want your blessing to have that conversation at the end of this week to give them their two week notice. And if I can't move forward with another candidate at this time to replace them, I understand, but I need the team to be great and in a unit is 1.",5.0

"My goal for this team is to create a system where workflows easily from one person to the next. So we have struggled with UM project management in the past and ensuring that we have a system for moving work along the pipeline. So what will happen is that will receive a brief from the strategy team, the strategy team will then brief the creatives, creatives will start their work and the timeline will be managed by a project manager along the way. Myself and my partner Eric as creative directors will be there to guide the team through each step of the process. Reach out with questions, any concerns, any issues, come to us first and we will manage it for you so you can get the work done when reviews are ready. Your job at that point is to reach out to Eric and myself. We want to see work when it's at its best point, but if you have a thought or a concern along the way, send it to us and we will. Work along that process throughout our goal for you. We would love to see you operate independently. We would love to see that. At a point, we won't even need to review the work. We want to trust this team enough and the quality of work that they're producing to be able to, at the end of the day, send it off to the client without us even needing to review it. Because we know, and we can trust that our team knows exactly. Knows the brand so well that they won't have to that we don't need to take a second look at it. You know, working at that level is what this agency expects. This team, you know, working on the United States Navy business, we have to operate in a little bit of a higher level because it is a government client because it does get so many eyes at the end of the day. So we love to see you improve your work quality to reach that level. Of um, level of quality for the US Navy, you know, that's our overall goal for this team is to follow our project management process which will hopefully improve the quality of work and the time that we have to do it.

"My philosophy is a manager is to lead with positive ITI you know, I I don't believe that anybody can do their job if they're feeling like they're constantly under the gun or psychologically insecure and what they're doing every day. So my goal is to encourage people rather than discourage people from the work that they're doing and how. Some ways that I think about doing that is the 1st way, UM is I want to make sure that I, my team knows that I'm going to be in the trenches. With them, there is no task that I would ask them to do that I wouldn't do myself, and I want to make sure that they know if they have a problem they can come to me there. For me their personal issues are always going to outweigh their work issues because you cannot do your job if you're worried about what's going on at home. And then the last way I would try to help my team is to um make sure that they know that there is the. The resource, whatever resources that they require, are accessible to them as long as they ask.

"On this current team, there are people we can operate, absolutely. There are people that we can operate without, and then there are people that I cannot operate without. So we have a team of juniors who are just learning how the process in AH and creative advertising works, and they do need quite a bit of supervision. And then we also have a senior team who they're seasoned, they know how to get things done, and I can count on them to get it done perfectly without any issues. Or complaints along the way. And then we have another senior who is struggling to um. I believe with some personal issues and then also with some quality of work issues and we've currently put that person on a performance plan to manage those expectations and show them that operating here is not OK and we're expecting a much higher quality of work. So that's our current team and our current roles. You know, I have one person on the team that I could hand the reins to tomorrow and I can guarantee the work would get done and it would be timely. But I don't think that person would be happy on this team. I think their skill set is so high quality that it truthfully belongs elsewhere at this point, and that's the best thing. That would be to help them grow, unfortunately. But I would hate to lose that person because of. The need because that would put much more stress on me. They would and they are my current #2 and my partner is still learning the ropes as well. So we have some dysfunction that we're currently working through to create the best product.",

"Hey there. I need to have a difficult conversation with you about John today. Is that OK? So John performed very well. After we had our initial conversation and our initial improvement chat, we brought in HR into the conversation. Expectations were made very clear of what he needed to accomplish in the quality of work that we needed to see coming from him. And it's been three months. We said we would regroup then and I don't feel that he is a fit for this team anymore based on the quality of work that I've seen. I think his he will perform much better elsewhere, whether it's on a different team or no longer with this company, but as it currently stands I am having to pick up the extra work that he is not accomplishing. At the end of the day, I would love your support in behind this and I would love to come up with a plan to work with HR to either transfer him to a team or his skill set. Might be a better fit or to remove him from the company permanently. I think he will be much happier at the end of the day because I don't think, I don't think his skill, I don't think he's using his skills to his full. Ability on this team because of the type of work that we do and I think it's causing him to lose track of what's important.

"OK my manager plan is. All around building process and um, making things smooth for my team members because neither of them work in the same office as me or in the same clients. Our KP eyes are more administrative and agency and efficiency focused. So our overall strategies are to build team skills and confidence, contribute to the larger analytics teams resources such as culture trends and then also getting daily team updates. Into projects without me micromanaging because I don't want to do that. And then our overall team KPIs are to deliver two to three proactive reports per year that provide additional value but haven't been asked for. And then our second P is to hit an 85% availability in terms of overall hours and productivity. And then thirdly to implement a project tracking system that we update daily so that I can be in the know about what they have going on. And help keep things moving along for their individual clients. Um, so our first process KPI is to implement Gantt charts in Smartsheet's to get all of the project tracking system set up and getting that into a routine of updating that on ongoing basis blockers would be? Time and making us a priority since that's more like administrative task versus uh client task. Also there's lack of skill and new to agencies with both my direct reports have been here six months or less. So I think a lack of skill and justice being new to the ways of VML INR is something that is a little bit of a block for them. Um 5% improvement ideas would be to meet with my team weekly formally and then informally twice a week just to check in and make sure they're feeling like they're part of the team since they are remote from me. And also connect them with mentors in their specific offices to make sure that they're building skills and have another resource person to learn from. And then also making sure that I'm keeping on top of the um percent bill ability to avoid five week low averages. And then another process, KPI, would be to learn one new analytics kill per year. And then from a calendar perspective, I listed everyone's birthdays and work anniversary's to celebrate the team um overall and then for March, have a goal for delivering a proactive report #1 and then November as a goal month for delivering a second proactive report just to make sure we're staying on top of that particular KP.",4.0

Through their career and giving them or making sure that they have opportunities for their own personal growth and to achieve their goals, whatever those may be. Um, I believe it's important to be honest and direct with that team 'cause I think that's the only way that's going. They're going to feel like they can trust me as well, um, and I really think like trust overall as a big core element of being a manager.

A little while back I had a tough, honest conversation with him, um, because of the feedback I've been getting about him and his attitude with the people. He's been working with UM and really laid out all of the areas of the skills he needed to develop um in order to really help improve relationships with the people that he works with and just overall. Deliver higher quality work output. He was very receptive to that conversation. Wasn't sure how you can take it at first, but um, he's very receptive to it and seem to have taken that feedback very seriously. Um, and really has turned things around. I'm very proud of the changes that he's made, um, and the progress that he's made in such a short amount of time. He seems very honest about the areas he needs to improve and the areas that. He is doing really well at and has a lot of really good goals lined out for his next year and seems to have a plan for everything, so very, very proud of the progress that he's made. David, on the other hand, I need to have a tough conversation with him next week. Kind of a similar boat that Tushar was in is where David is at right now. Um, not seeing a lot of really great work output or a lot of productive time spent. So I've outlined a plan. For him to improve that development. So will be delivering that and speaking with him next week and hoping to turn his progress around as well. He's new, he's only been here two months.

But he's also in the weeds of analytics similar to me. So we do have some overlap in in that way. But I really am happy with the relationship I have with my boss. He's has a lot of trust in faith and need to be able to do my job, but he's also always available if I feel like I need support in anyway.

I know this is something that we've worked hard to try to improve their performance. We did speak with them a few months ago about performance. We saw slight improve improvements, but they've really slipped back into. Their old habits and at this point it's jeopardizing our relationships with the client. So I really feel like it's best if we, you know, let them go. Um, would love to hear your thoughts about this or um. If you have any other concerns or questions, um would also love to discuss with you um, the you know the best way to speak with this person or invite you to do that with me if you'd like to.

"Hi there. I'd like to share with you my management plan. Our team is in a bit of flux, um, so I've developed one that's going to be a little more fluid and assessed every quarter. Um, first staff. Actually, the first three things I want to accomplish are getting the right people. I want to re energize re energize those people and then establish consistency. Um, getting back to the right people. Um getting the right people on the bus and recasting the talent as needed. Right now we've absorbed people from different teams. There's been layoffs, there's been shifts, people been placed in positions because they were essentially a warm body. So to say there maybe not the right people or the right talent for that role, I really want to dig in and understand what makes my direct reports tick. I want to set up those 45 minute meetings with them, really understand their goals professionally and personally and then identify. From there, the rock stars versus superstars um. Then I want to identify the superstars and start priming and focus on finding my number one and then my #2 um. There's definitely some people on the team that are. Are currently and could be great managers, and there's definitely some more of the rock stars that do their thing. They do it well, but they're just not in it and cut out to be a manager. Um, second, I want to go back. Um, I want to re energize 18 months. We get the right people on the bus and the right talent, so to say. Um, we've been working from home. A lot of them are not coming into the office. I want to at least set up some statuses. And get them excited about coming into the office, re energized the team, do some fun team outings and get them excited and invested in the work and then the output of that get that 5% stretch from them, have them enjoy and just say what can we get a little bit more I think having some in person. Activities and some in person accountability if you will, is going to help give us that stretch goal. Um and 3rd establish consistency. Right now things are siloed a bit across err 3 disciplines in the business which are paid, owned and eh calm, um, the outputs are different, we have different status, meetings are run differently, deliverables to clients are sent differently. It's just the consistency is not there. So really want to take an assessment, get the sub semi subject matter experts in to help assess and provide consistency, um, measurement in measuring all these is going to be hugely important. Real time feedback with the team checking in how they're doing, if they are being shifted into new positions, how are they doing and then will also measure, measure this by client feedback via surveys and then performance. Um. So in summary, I management plan is going to be fluid and it's going to shift or be reassessed every quarter, but I want to focus on getting first the right people, the right talent. I want to re energize the team and then three aiming to be an established consensus consistency. Across the team, thank you.",3.0

"Hello, I'm here to talk to you today about the game of golf, which is my favorite game in the world. The game of golf is in sport, played individually. There usually are not teams involved. It is played with a ball and a Golf Club which is used to hit advance swing, strike the ball. Um, you start in the starting area called AT and you swing the club. Add a stationary ball which is then. Hit down and open field for the most part into a finish area called Green and it has all played normally on grass. And on the green is a hole in the ground referred to as a cup, which is just a little bit bigger than a ball. And the object of this game is to get the ball from that starting area, that E to the green into the hole in as few strokes as possible. The ball does not move. You have to wait for the ball to be stationary, and this game is unique in the fact that the rules are not. Enforced by a player or, excuse me, not enforced by a referee or an umpire or anyone of that nature. The game is actually. Refereed by the players themselves against themselves. So it's up to one's individual honor to uphold the rules and play fairly um, all the way through your round. Now each one of these holes start to finish as a whole, and you play either 9 or 18 holes usually, and I think one of the. Least appreciated aspects of this game is the social aspect. Um, since you're playing individually. You're not necessarily trying to beat your opponent, you're trying to get a better score for yourself. So that allows for comraderie because you can help each other while you play with each other. Thank you.",6.0

"So my 2 minutes teach is about process capability. So process capability is say it's more than it's a statistical measurement of a process ability to produce parts within a specified limit on a consistent basis. So process capabilities, more than just measuring a few values is really a statistical process control is a tool of the statistical process control toolbox, so. Implementing statistical process control is not jazz computing in number of measurements like CD case. It also involves like collecting the data from their process and a chronological order that covers the variation in the process including shifts, operators and analyzing the data to understand this city cycle performance audio process and also to identify the causes of variation within that process. So. Is is very important to understand all those things. So once we have that, then what we're going to do is basically calculate the process capability measurements after we know there are processes in control and most of the time what we do is assume that our data is normally distributed and we calculate those measurements using the mean and standard deviation. The problem is that when you process is not normal then using the mean and standard deviation. Is not the correct way to do it. Do you need to use the pencil to percentiles?

"Good morning. My name is Ryan Jenkins. I'm just gonna do a quick talk about how I ended up in my current role. So I graduated from the University of Michigan last May with my Masters degree. And the reason? The way they found out about GE was originally through my professor um for my Masters degree. I talked with him in the fall and he suggested that I look into. GE Aviation, they're down in Ohio they think would be really good for what you're looking to do and I kind of dismissed it 'cause I went to miss again. I didn't really want to move to Ohio but. As I moved through the semester and then into the winter, I started. Looking for more positions and I kind of broaden my horizons. And I got connected with a Michigan alum who works at GE at the career fair, and I had a long talk with him. He I connected with him on LinkedIn and he suggested from positions for me to apply to, which I went ahead and did. I ended up getting an interview, and the interview I think went pretty well obviously, and they told me that they would like to hire me, but that none of the managers who had interviewed me that day thought I would be a good fit for their role. So I went to this kind of state of limbo of well. We want to hire you but we don't know where to put you. And so they said they would have a meeting the following day to try and place me. And I luckily got a phone call from my new current manager and he basically said that he decided to hire me based off the recommendation of the alumni that I had networked with. So I think it's pretty cool that I was able to end up in my current role by working with my schools alumni and end up at a great company. So yeah, that's how I ended up here.",5.0
"For my 2 minute teach, I'm going to give a quick overview of a collegiate rowing. So during my four years of undergrad, I was on the men's rowing team. Not a lot of people have been exposed to the sport, so um, as a high level overview, the. The premiere event is the 8 man boat or the eight women vote, and in that boat each person has one or there's four or is each side, and there is a coxswain that sits in the stern that steers and coordinates all of the rowers, making sure they're all growing in time. Um, the. The main races that you see at the Olympics and at the World Championship are 2000 meters and with an 8 man boat that can take anywhere from a little under 6 minutes to almost seven depending on the conditions and the fitness of the crew. There's a whole bunch of other types of boats where you could have got four guys. Two guys know Cox in um. But the other main category of rowing is sculling, where each row has two wars with the other type called sweetberry of one or. And in that class you can have people both with one person, votes with two people and boats with four people. Yeah. I was introduced to rowing while I was in college and I really enjoyed this board and it's not something that everyone gets exposed to in high school, but I think it's a really good sport it trains you to. Very hard independently outside of practice, but also come together with your team. Because in order for a boat to go fast, everyone needs to be in think and.

One thing that I can prove is, um, well I like them a lot, so it's kind of distracting sitting behind my best buddy who we share a cubicle and um, it could be pretty easy to turn around and just crack a joke rather than trying to keep working on the model or the PowerPoint that you have.

But if you think about all the paper towels, coffee cups, food wrappers, just all the little things that it adds up really quickly with how much trash you produce. And to kind of put in perspective, um, one work week that's. For £20.00 of trash and then. Not including weekends where you probably produce more garbage 'cause you're not working all day, within a month you've produced over 100 pounds of garbage, which most people would probably struggle to carry. And I just think that's astounding and it's a good perspective to think about. In your day-to-day life where it's like, do I really need to grab? At disposable cup? Or should I bring a water bottle? Or can I make coffee at home and or use reusable wrappers for my lunch and I just think that's a crazy number.",5.0

So you need to gather your ingredients which is 2 cups of flour, 1 cup of sugar, three bananas, half a cup of butter, a fourth teaspoon of salt, one teaspoon of vanilla, and two eggs. The the keys to getting bananas that are ripe, which means it kind of started looking brown, like something you wouldn't want to eat. And to make sure your butter has softened to room temperature, which is great to put out in the morning. Then by afternoon it's ready to roll. So you mix your, what I would kind of call your wet ingredients, your butter, your eggs, your vanilla, your salt. Um and your crashed. Um, your your question bananas.

You have at this time Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. When that happens, which depends on the oven, mine takes probably about 8 minutes to do that. You put the batter into a bread pan. Now, there's many different shapes and sizes of bread pans, so if you look for smaller pieces or larger pieces, it's probably dependent on the panel to use, but you put. Your mixture into pan and you stick it in your preheated oven. Depending on the size of the pan it will take between 45 minutes to an hour.

"How I got to the position I'm in now is. Long journey, I guess. I graduated with a degree in manufacturing engineering and out of school. I was a subcontractor on a hardware line where we built EMM.

And for so many years that really bothered me. But then I learned to let my love of curiosity, of learning guide my career step by step. And what that has done for me is instead of a straight line, this traditional trajectory, a ladder if you will. My career journey has been a road full of twists and turns along the way. I started out my career two weeks after college graduation at Amgen, which is a 24 hour manufacturing facility, and I did a variety of things. I worked in process development, I worked in manufacturing or worked in project management, and then I made a critical decision where I wanted to manage people directly and I moved into a QC manager role. Where I had no educational background in QC and really had to rely on my people. From there, I took the step to move to Millipore Sigma, where I've been for the last seven years, and I've done a variety of roles from commercial to marketing management to leading eh, a franchise. And now in my current role managing a program, I've bounced between people management and direct management, individual contributor roles, and that's perfectly OK. It's OK if your career doesn't go in a straight. And to close this talk, I'd really like everyone think about their career journey more as a personal development journey. What you need at any one point in time may change, but the whole purpose is to continue to grow and to continue to impact the lives of others through that growth and you will continuously move forward in your career.

"In a world where we are busier than ever, what if I told you there was a way to stay energized, fueled, and focused all day long? Well, I've done it and I want to share how. I'm going to give you 5 simple habits that you can build into your life that will keep you feeling great all the time. First and foremost, food. Food is your fuel. Nutrition is what keeps you going. Always make sure that you're combining carbs, which are going to be the kindling to your fire with some protein and some fat, which are going to be those slow burning logs that give you, say, ****** and keep you energized long-term. Second, hydration, you wanna make sure you're drinking half your body weight in. Ounces of water and instead of drinking coffee throughout the day to keep your energy, you want to add a little bit of lemon or high quality salt to your your water, which is going to actually give you that energy boost. 3rd is sleep. Making sure you're getting seven or more hours of sleep every night is so critical to sustained energy. If you're having trouble do that, try this simple step. You're going to just go to bed 5 or 10 minutes earlier every night for a week, and that will start to build up that hour or more of sleep that you're not getting. #4 move move your body, preferably in nature. Get some sunlight, get some vitamin D This is really important. Just walking outside in between meetings can be a great way to kind of re energize. And then the last one is recovery. So a lot of people think stress is the enemy. Stress is not the enemy. Clever cover is critical. We actually all need stress. To push ourselves to strengthen those muscles. But recovery is critical. And recovery is not just a vacation every six months, it's building those recovery points into your day, every day. That's going to make you feel your best all day long.",7.0

One thing that I do think we could improve is that we need to have a better understanding of our total resource capacity and then we need to make some very difficult prioritization decisions as a result of that understanding of what our capacity is. Right now, we have too many people working on too many different things. Many of those things may not even be high priority or aligned with our strategic direction.

It's going to contribute, contribute to a healthier workforce, less stressed employees if they're taking breaks throughout the day and we're encouraging people to take steps. So what can we do to encourage people to take steps? I was thinking maybe we could create an incentive program where people log their steps on a daily basis and they're hitting certain targets. We can reward them either with prizes or money towards their health insurance. Something to. Signify that they're taking those steps.",6.0
"Successful collaboration with China is discounting strategy. Pricing is a very sensitive topic. In certain regions around the world were marked as business. China is one example. Due to high cost pressures from local competitors and from the government, the bioprocessing market is growing very fast there and has a lot of future potential. In order for us to be successful, we need to pay close attention to how we price our offerings. Setting the right price involves a tradeoff. Between gaining market share and pocketing the profits. In other words, he can win more customers by offering steeper discounts, but your profitability will suffer and vice versa. We approached finding a sweet spot in three steps, historical price assessment, trade margin analysis and final discount recommendation. We began by analyzing historical selling prices and with the help of the China team, segmenting them by customer application. We split the high and the low paying accounts into 2 categories and assessed which ones are strategic and which ones are opportunistic, while signed margin targets to the strategic category which is only slightly above the average selling price. By staying in the range of the actual selling price, we convinced our field colleagues that customers will be willing to pay that much. Also by performing the segmentation analysis, we reinforced our business expectation for opportunistic accounts. They are expected to pay more. While we as product managers have an ultimate say in the final price and discount, it's critical to get our local colleagues on board. Their full support will make us stronger as a whole mark organization, but also will alleviate the unnecessary and unproductive load of handling each account in silo. Thank you.",6.0

Swap the goalkeepers as needed throughout the game to make sure others get to rest and that everyone gets to practice and improve their skills. Next, assess the other team. Understand their players and their strategy. If they have an outstanding player whose skills and physical endurance are above average. And sure to keep them blocked at all times during the game. Adjust the strategy is needed, especially if you have new players joining. Many soccer is typically a high scoring game. If you are two points ahead, shift towards defense. Keep in mind that they feel used to uh, regular outdoor soccer. This version of it requires different techniques since the ball is much lighter and the distances are shorter. When they hit the ball, it's all about the aim and about just enough amount of power, not too much and not too little. Ensure your warmed up and stretched beforehand. It's recommended to play this at the end of the workout. What makes this game great is that anyone can join and create roughly equal teams. Experience matters much less here. Good luck and have fun.",6.0

"Hey, how are you? Good to see you. Um. Wanted to tell you I went on the greatest vacation ever. Just got back the other day. It was on a Caribbean cruise. It was six nights, which was perfect duration before you get too much over cabin fever. And we went all around the Caribbean Sea and we hit up islands that you normally wouldn't make you way too because they would be too far away from the airport or from the mainland. But because of their village of the cruise ship to go around, it's so easy to get. On and off. They also tend to have the nicest beaches because there are further out in the water and they don't have those rocky areas or shades from large hotel buildings or from skyscrapers. Really enjoyed that part. Another thing which was great, I found the food on cruise ship speed better than an average all inclusive resort. We actually got some high quality steak and very nice drinks. Super highly recommend.",

I like that people are people are very friendly, they're nice, they're willing to help, and they are willing to collaborate. Sometimes I struggle though, because it's a huge company and it's changing so much depending on the market dynamics that it seems like it's constantly going through a transformation and with each transformation there comes a change to which we need to adapt to. For example, there are all these new functions being created, and we don't always know what exactly they're supposed to do and how exactly they're supposed to help us do our job. So my ask for the management is to make these things more clear far in advance so that we can all work together successfully and deliver the best results.",7.0

"So for my 2 miniature teach, I'm going to teach you all how to use a smoker. Um. And this is one of the things that I like to do in my free time brings. I think it's one of the more fun ways to cook um. And to begin what we have to start talking, thinking about is what we would want to smoke 'cause you can start with veggies where it's just pretty much using it like an oven. You can use chicken where it's breast, wings and he types of chicken. You can do seafood like salmon, you could do pork, do pulled pork or you can do some sort of pulled pork ribs or you could do. Beef like a brisket. And the first thing you have to think about is what type of wood would he use? So yeah, cherry, Hickory, Maple, and all of that contributes to the flavor that you use. Personally, I like using Maple and Hickory. That's just my flake flavors that I enjoy the most. But. Um. That's the type of words that you could use, and then you have to know how to cook it. So each. Each different type of food is cooked it different way. So for your breasts are you really need to keep it low and slow and let that meat marinade soak up all that smoke and then something like chicken where it will only take you an hour or two to make. You also have to think about if you want to add any of Blackwood in there and you also have to think about how you want that. Even like put the ribs, you really want it to be like fall off the bone, but you also have to put on your BBQ sauce. But yeah, so for your chicken you go in. Put your rub on the chicken, select your type of what I would normally use, Maple or Hickory or mix of both and then from there cook it for about an hour and a half and then from there you have the perfect chicken wings.",4.0

And I attended Saint Xavier High School. Graduated in 2017. From there, I moved on to the University of Cincinnati. And I studied mechanical engineering. I did 4 Co-op rotations at Aurora Casket Company. Which is out in Aurora IN where I did a lot of manufacturing um and supported the manufacturing process. And I really enjoyed that.

I just started in. At the end of May, so I have not done too much. But I am getting into the swing of things here. And I'm starting to get my own projects. Um.

"Do you know the most euthanized animal in the shelters? If you guessed little, kittens, you're right. More than 50% of euthanized animals or unweaned kittens weaning happens at 4 weeks. So only about 2/5 of the kittens that come into shelters under 4 weeks will actually survive until eight week adoptions. When the kittens do not eat, they must be tube fed. That's what I'm going to teach you about today. So this involves putting a tube down their throat and into their stomach, and then using a syringe to put milk right into the stomach. To start, you're going to line up the tube outside of the belly. And. So that it lines up about with the belly button. Marking where the top of the mouth meets it. Next you wanna. What the tube with milk? So you're going to just dip it in milk and then push a little bit of milk through the syringe and attach the syringe.

Qualified to do these on the kittens? And. Most of the kittens that come in have medical problems and so you have to also be careful with that. They also eat every two. Um, hours. So that's a lot of time. So once it too busy then you're going to put it down the back of the kittens throat. And if they cry, that's good. It means you're in.

So as far as the improvements. And the 5% improvement ideas, it's just document shape documentation for tracking those things, documentation for standards and best practices for the tracking of the creative growth, most likely through meetings or note meeting notes and whatnot.

Day today all that often it might be once or twice throughout the week for some of them even maybe not even for a week or so with others. But generally the editors that I don't connect with is often are better at handling their own day today and not much of a need for me to be around as often. But there are a number of lower level editors that I do hear from quite often or need to be involved. With more regularly and going through this process of the management training it's I may need to kind of switch that up a bit to where I'm focusing in with the stronger performers and helping them grow versus some of the weaker performers and. And that's that's a reframing of my mindset 'cause I want to help the weakest to become strong and stronger. Because I feel that the stronger team members are able to handle their own issues if they come up or they don't need my assistance as much as the weaker reformers. But I I see the value in building the stronger team members and making them better and that would also in turn probably allowed those team members to to. The weaker team members and not me directly so but that that is kind of my assessment of how I feel about the team broadly. Thank you.",
"In this video we're supposed to describe our boss and what they do with the company. Steve Stone is who I report to. That is in, um, somebody that I've worked with for awhile now. Just recently, about a couple weeks ago there was a round of layoffs. So he was not. My direct superior supervisor, was Casey Steele. He's been let go and now we're not as Steve again. But I've worked more directly with and closely with Steve for for many years. He. Heads up our post production side of our department and basically is, I don't wanna say the top producer, but he handles a lot of the business, manages the producers and then from the trickle down is the editorial and animation side of things. Um, he is. He's one of the better managers that I've had. He is great at um, at growing his team. He teaches well. And I've learned a lot from him and um. Um, eager to become a better manager to help him also manage better.",
"In this video, I'm needing to pretend as if I'm speaking with my boss, having a difficult conversation about a team member that is underperforming. And that I mean we're needing to let go. Um, so with that and pretending, I will begin with Steve. Need to talk to you real quick. May I? Great. We've got so and so on the team. I've talked with him a number of times. It really really given them a chance to work through some of their issues as as you know there's been flaws in in errors and the videos that they've they've put out and you know just missing feedback, not addressing notes from the team from the creative teams that were needed to be included in an updated rounds of of the edit. Worked with them. Also you know more directly to see. The edits before they go out do a little Q eh a number of things that I caught but but they they clearly were missing the mark and and after having improved for a little while. Have slipped back into to having a number of errors in their edits. At this point, I don't believe that they'll be able to break out of that habit of maybe. Being, uh, being better at catching those things, I I feel like they're just going to keep coming back to. Having those errors and it's it's actually becoming I think a concern for the business to where the that team that we're working with um. Is is looking to pull the work that they do with our department and go elsewhere with it. So it's not just a question of um, can this person be saved or worked with to address these needs. It's it's a concern for lost, lost business. So I I think that at this point it's a conversation we have with HR about letting this person go.",4.0
"In this video, we're being asked to discuss what we would say to our team to help build an IKEA desk the fastest, competing against other teams. I would probably start with some sort of incentive fication, understanding that we're competing against teams and if we win. Uh, maybe a round of beers or something on me. Then from there, look at the. Look at the instructions themselves. Uh and divvy up who may be strongest for one piece or the other? Um. Some people may be better with their hands physically, others might be more organized and identifying who could do what as far as like organizing the pieces. And then another person assembling and in what order needs to go 1st and leaving the glass top till last. Because that is a very delicate piece of the puzzle here on a desk that's being built with four people quickly. So probably set that to the side letting it um. Be there and and together all of us probably put the final topping on on the desk and of course be done first. So. Thanks.",4.0
"I am. My journey to my current role as the HR manager started very much by accident. You often hear people say I fell into this career and this is true for me as well. It all started in 1992 um with the standard register company. I was still in college and I'd started to roll this and he started a role as a summer job only as an HR intern with the Standfast group. As the summer came to an end my manager came to me and asked would I like to stay on with the organization and I decided I wanted to do that um and work full time while I continue to go to school. So I worked my way up from an intern to an HR. Distance up to an HR generalist within the organization. In 1998 the Standard Register, which Standfast Group was apart of, decided to implement a new HR and payroll system, PeopleSoft. I was still working as an HR generalist within the Standfast group and I was not originally part of that implementation project. There was a need for someone to join the project to help with position management. Halfway through the implementation I was asked if I would be willing to do a bubble assignment and assists with the project, and I did. It was from that implementation that I found I had interest and skill set in HR systems. I continue to move into HR roles in standard register in up to a senior HRMS technical specialist. At that point I decided it was time for me to explore other opportunities to expand and develop my skills and the HR technology space. In 2001, I accepted a position with NCR as a HR practice, consulting and staffing operations. This role allowed me to continue developing new skills with HR technology, particularly in the talent acquisition recruiting space. From there I moved into a continued to move into more progressive roles with various organizations from Provident Bank, UM as an HR operations manager up to where I am now. As the HR manager for GE Aviation.",6.0
"One of my favorite meals is a recipe that was given to me by um moment. I consider a second mother. It is called baked spaghetti. This is one of our families favorite comfort foods.

Continue to stir and break the meat up into smaller pieces until this into very fine pieces of, um, smaller chunks of meat Azure cooking the ground beef mixture. Add salt and pepper to the meat as well for seasoning, and that will also get into the to the to the grease that's emitting from the ground beef and help flavor the meat. You'll cook until it's clicked through and no longer pink. In the center, you'll remove the ground beef from the pan and drain. Increase from the meat. In another large pot, Gilad um your spaghetti sauce and include the ground beef that you just cooked into that spaghetti sauce. You'll let that cook and simmer for about 20 minutes.

"So my favorite vacation destination would be um, any cruise to be err frankly honest, any cruise in the Caribbean. I have gone to sanwan, I've gone to Saint Croix, um Kurasou, Jamaica and I've done cruises on all of those. And you will love about cruising is the fact that you're on this ship, it's beautiful, you're in the ocean, there's so much food and entertainment on the ship, but then you also able to stop at different ports. Again, since it's in one and take excursions, you do day tours there so you're able to stop and get a little bit of the culture. In in different places and cruises also allow you to hit different many different places at once. Another one of my favorite cruises that I took was actually a Mediterranean cruise that left out of Barcelona and went into you went through Roman to Italy, into France, and as part of our excursions I was able to see the Vatican and that was just absolutely beautiful. So I would highly encourage you to take a cruise, particularly Caribbean or maybe even the Mediterranean.",

I mean you know if I need have any questions understanding that I'm new and I'm still learning and being there to support me in my as I continue my journey and learning.

"Hello. So on average. A person takes seventy 7500 steps per day. If you think about that 7500 steps per day, it's approximately 3 miles. Now when you consider that most people would not realize it that 7500 steps is 3 miles, almost 3 miles of three mile walk. Although health experts recommend 10,000 steps per day, 7500 is about the average. And then if you think about that even further, when you have a 5K walk, a 5K walk is the equivalent to 3.1 miles. There are lots of people in this world who think, yeah, I could never do a 5K walk. I'll be honest, I wanted the first one to say, yeah, I could never participate in 5K walk.

When we have gaps, were willing to share, bring up, level up the team. It's it's been wonderful very much enjoy it. I hate to say it, and this is petty, but if I could improve one thing, it is the coffee. It's terrible, but it. It is sponsored by our managers and that's lovely, but it's awful so.

"Hello, this is Matt. Nice to meet you. I'd like to talk to you a little bit about my career path and how I got to be where I am today at GE. Um started as a mechanical engineer and college or university. And then transitioned to machine tool design manufacturing background. Still wasn't too sure what I wanted to be when I grew up, so it was a good opportunity to get a mix of a few different possible career paths from their transition to a robotics company Morina design role. I really enjoyed that at the time as I got a little bit older, settled down, started a family we want it to be a little bit closer to. Our home base, if you will. So we ended up moving um back closer to home to be with friends and family. And at that point transition more into aerospace, working on very small turbines to start with, engines that GE would probably call toys, um, engines that you could put under your arm and carry around if you wanted to. And we did that for about 8 or 9 years and then transitioned here to GE Aviation, Now GE Aerospace. Working still mechanical components that eventually graduated if you will. So I guess bigger and better roles. So right now I'm ah, technical leader for what GE Aviation now aerospace would call technical colombianas and my job along with my team of 25 to 30. Um, teammates is to try to keep, err, engines clean. Sounds a bit silly. Um, we spend quite a bit of money. Time, money, resources, um with engine durability issues if engines are not clean. So we do our best to make sure piece parts, modules, assemblies and the engines themselves are clean before they ship out. Thank you.",4.0
"Hello, my name is Matt and I like to talk to you about food. My favorite food is a peanut butter and Jelly sandwich. Not familiar with this classic sandwich. All that is required are two slices of bread and you guys took a little bit of peanut butter, a little bit of Jelly. That is it. Simple ingredients, easy to make. Healthy. Maybe. Delicious, certainly. So let's talk construction. Take one of those pieces of bread again, whatever bread do you prefer. Put a nice smooth coating peanut butter on one side and then do the same for the other very important stuff. Make sure you put peanut butter only on one side of that bread. If you do on both sides, you might have a mess on your hands. Time for a little pro tip? Make sure you spread that peanut butter nice and smooth from edge to edge. The goal is going to be 100% coverage. Not 90, not 80, but 100% coverage. Cover up all those nooks and crannies. Cover up any holes in the bread that will prevent the. Typical potential issue to have a Jelly incident later on. A whole bunch of Jelly in your bag somewhere else. Once you've got that sorted out, find your favorite Jelly and you guys to put a scoop of that right in the middle of one of those slices of bread. Important again, put the Jelly against the peanut butter, not on the other side. Again, we want to prevent any type of Jelly incidents as we go forward. Spread that out nice and smooth. Be careful not to put that Jelly on the floor on the counter. Make sure it goes in between those pieces of bread. Right against the peanut butter. Assemble your sandwich and there you have it. My favorite food again. Healthy. Maybe. Certainly delicious. Easy to make. Nice to have on the go. Hope you enjoy. Bye.",5.0
"So people are living a lot more of a sedentary lifestyle nowadays compared to what we used to wear. That will be in work, working in an office. You're sitting down every time you're watching TV. Sitting down, everyone dies on the couch a lot. If you're going to be driving somewhere, wherever anybody needs to get to you tend to go in your car, you're going to be doing it sitting down. We don't walk as much as we used to. Nowadays the average steps of each person per day is only 7 files and 500. A few ways that you can try and off your average walking each day will possibly be try and walk to work. If you need to go to the shops instead of taking your car, use your bike. Or you can just walk there instead in your lunch break instead of just sitting down for the full half an hour or an hour, however long you take, go for a little stroll.

"I've just joined you, so I'm a bit of a new starter.

So I feel like that's really being a strong point. Since I've joined, one of the weaker points I'd say is that my keenness to try and get work done. Those leads to me rushing things a little bit and I find for that also can follow through into my communication with people. So that's when I'm trying to communicate things. I'll make little mistakes and when I'm doing work fine. But sometimes I can rush it instead of taking a little step back and then analyze it to be able to communicate properly or doing the work to the best of my abilities.",5.0

"My favorite vacation destination has got to be Egypt. It's the most incredible place that I've ever been. So so you step off the airplane and the first thing that hits you is just a massive wall of heat. So it's sort of like stepping into an oven. So the other reasons why I love Egypt so much is because of the snorkel in the Red Sea and the beautiful white beaches. You go into the water and you put your head into it while you snorkel in, put your goggles on and then you're just like transported into a completely different world. I remember last time I've got to swim with wild turtles that were just common across huge 2 meter turtles, Soren, Eagle Ray one time as well. Another reason is the incredible food and the people are probably the friendliest people I've ever met, but that could just be because I'm from Liverpool and they love Mohammed Saleh.",
"So I'm going to talk about how I ended up here in my current role as a mechanical design engineer for GE and check them. So for as long as I can remember I've always loved maths and physics in anything to do with problem solving. So when I was doing my A levels so decided to take maths and physics which were my two favorite subjects at the time. So manage to get in alright grade and that and then moving into university wanted to do a course where I'd be able to. Incorporate both ***** and learning more about the physical world. So I decided to go for aerospace engineering. Um 'cause I know it's a good chance to work with different teams across different companies. Can do lots of maths, lots of problem solving, can learn a lot more about physics. You know everything from there were dynamics across 2 solids and structures and different stress work. So ah completes um University degree and got my masters, first class masters. Then it's OK year I wanted to do a little bit of traveling, just as a little break away from their how hectic it was and it's a little bit of a rest bye. So after that year I decided to get a job down in Shelton in the UK. I went to work for a company called Triumph Actuation who did a lot of work on different valves and landing gear across the different span of aircrafts, submarine work, that sort of thing. And after two years then moved on into my current role GE as a mechanical design engineer. And now I'm working more on the electrical mechanical side of things.",5.0
"My 2 minutes each is going to be on the basic stunts of kickboxing. So you want to stand face on C opponents or whichever way you're going to be fighting. Then you want to put your left foot or your weaker foot forward and then slightly turn. So a slight angle. From then on, you want to make sure your tires are pointed slightly off center, so sort of the way that you're facing, and then you want to raise your left hand to be in front of you. Bit further and you want to talk your right hand right next to your chin, so always protect it. And from then on, if your opponent is closer, you want to bring that hand a little bit closer here. Or if the further away you want to move that hand further away. It's a control your distance and control your range. So with your chin, you want to make sure that your tent chin is tucked down so it's closer to your chest and you can still look forward. And when you are going to go for a job, you will use your front hand. It's a slowly extend it and then bring it back again. And as you extend it, you want to protect your chin with your shoulder in case another shot comes over to try and get you. So for the other basic points that we're going to do is across which is using your stronger hand or your rear hand. Which going forward and extend it. And again, you want to use your shoulder, I'll talk that into your chin. So any shots were going to come in your way aren't going to get to him. Uh, another technique for the basics of kickboxing. Is, uh, hook, which is where you want to make sure that this hand is always protecting your chin and you want to talk the talk of your arm in. Unsleep that through.",5.0
"So my manager plan um is really based around the idea of growth. Um, our team. The, the main goal for us is to grow and to continue to contribute in that way to the agency. And I kind of broke it down in, in several ways that I think are going to be useful tactics for us to grow, continue to contribute in a meaningful way. So key goals for us are going to be to engage new teams at the agency um, continue to expand our team skill set outside of the types of design that we're doing right now and then also streamline the way we work within. The agency, there are so many different small pieces that come together within VM INR, finding a way for our team to more easily work with in all of those different operations, um, so-called operations, I think will be a really big opportunity for growth within our team, um. So one of the improvement ideas that I had for this was to kind of send our team out on the road again, what we used to call the Creative Services Roadshow to introduce ourselves again to the agency. So people who would benefit from working with our team have an opportunity to meet us to learn what we're capable of and how to engage with us, which I think can sometimes be a blocker for people outside of creative services and who maybe don't have a great understanding of what our team does right now. Um, some strategies that I think would be useful in sending us forward in into our CPF growth is um. Using kind of our current work workload and forecasting the way that our current workload has been going to understand how many resources we might be able to support moving forward into 2023. Um were already on a great path to getting. More members added to kind of give us the competitive edge in taking care of more work. I think we can standardize and streamline our meetings so that resourcing is quicker and more efficient and that we can kind of get get things assigned faster and make sure that our team stays as busy as possible and then I think. Figuring out the way that our time keeping systems works within the interagency. Working will be a huge help in how we can continue to work faster, better, smarter with all of the teams at the mill liner and that will contribute in a great way to us growing and continuing to be a valued team.",6.0

Having her own burn reporting which is 1. Being involved in scoping. For our team to have a voice in the decision making process, to be able to analyze and look at the deliverables and the amount of people it's going to take on the right skill sets and then be able to evaluate her decision as she owns that work moving forward for next year.

"My philosophy is a manager is to always be available and not only opened but letting my team feel open to coming to me with areas to consult on to support them in. Rather than telling them what they should be doing or teaching them in a forest manner, I would like to give them opportunities for exposure and be able to generate their own questions and thought starters. So that they feel engaged and opportunities and that they feel trusted at buying me to own new areas and express themselves and develop their skill sets in showcasing their capabilities to an elevated audience that they may not normally get exposure to.",5.0

"I'm alisa. I know that you, when you first gave prints to me to help, mentor and manage, you were really rooting for him. You thought he had a lot of growth potential and opportunity to succeed within our organization and to contribute and was just a really talented individual and we wanted to help him grow. And I identified areas that I thought would be good for him to get exposure to because of his current client work base, just not giving him the opportunity to. Excel and show his project management skills. I talked about him about areas of business he was interested in and he really wanted to get promoted as well, but to do so his current work wasn't showing him those project management techniques. So he was able to get with the wall and start to do so, however. She and I both are in alignment and agreement that he's not following direction, while he is being given the opportunity to learn from the ground up and start simple, following a checklist so that we can see how he processes instructions and he is skipping over that. He's not taking notes. He's great at communicating with clients, but the problem is he's not. Following through with the work that needs to be done. So at this time with the lack of resources that we already have on the team, we feel strongly that we either need to move him to a different department or we need to let him go because he's just not able to fulfill the basic necessities as a project manager.",5.0

"I'm Melissa. Meghan is doing well. She is. Trying to open herself up for input and feedback from the team members that have expressed it to myself about her involvement and knowledge of the work. They are having problems where they feel that she is not having a voice in meetings more because she's not comfortable with the work and that she is not responding timely to deliverables that clients are asking for. They feel that she needs to operate in too much structure and is uncomfortable with work in progress or some ambiguity or generalizing things in order to get things out the door to clients. When the clients are comfortable with, um, more basic framework for timelines, for example, they don't need all the details. They just would like to see a road map of um phases that we'd be at for the work and roughly how long it would take versus specific dates and specific tasks. So I've been able to give her the feedback from the team members, and I applaud her because she's actually gone to the individual team members and ask them to provide her feedback real time as they're seeing it in meetings. So that way she can learn from specific examples versus generalities, which is something that I also encouraged the team undoing because it's easier for myself. Also, if I'm getting that feedback, knowing specific examples, I can put myself in Megan shoes and determine if I would do the same thing or what advice. I could give her on how to handle it differently in the future.",
"I've identified some ways for us to increase our capacity as proofreaders within the agency. Um, there are several things we're going to start doing as a team and. Individually to. Um, make us more effective. So the first thing we're going to do is. Um, we are going to try and increase our bill ability from Q3 to Q4 by 20% each. Um, I know this could be tricky because we do still have internal needs, but if we could spend more time with our client work, like if we could add an hour or 90 minutes a day that we would have previously spent on internal needs. We're going to talk about exactly what that means and how we're going to balance that. But if everyone could do that, we're also going to be getting reaching out to more client teams rather than making sure the internal teams are taking care of. We will still do that work. But we also need to really focus on Bill ability this quarter. So that is something each of us need to do individually as a team. Like I said, we're going to try and reach out to more client teams. Everyone might have an assignment to talk to someone or e-mail someone and solicit work and see what their needs are, so that's something we will be working on. Um, we're also going to be having check in so we can discuss this. I will track the bill ability. You don't have to worry about that, but we'll have checkins every week or every other week depending on how the month is going to. Assess this. Something that we want to build toward as a whole as a team is becoming not just approving department, but maybe a copy studio or copy services or we're still playing with the name, but that is something. If you have any ideas I would love to hear them. Instead of just being proofreaders, and might encompass having editors and. Writers and maybe the medical editors join us in the proofreaders from Miami join our team, but it'll be more of a studio or services group that can accommodate more needs. Um. And one final thing. We're gonna I'm gonna start trying to audit for consistency. And. I'm sorry, the.

Personally, they don't need to get personal, but I want them to feel comfortable talking to me about what. They need from me and most well, not emotionally that seems a little too extreme, but just what they need. So I want everyone to always feel comfortable on my team and we make decisions together about what's right for the team.

They're being asked to be more billable, even though we're doing work that's. We're working 100% of our time even though it's sometimes it's internal numbers. Even when we're using those, it is a lot of work. So it's just it's really hard to do what we do 8 hours a day and then sometimes be expected to continue it into the evenings and or on weekends. And if we could know for sure that we're getting merit raises or even cost of living raises at this point because inflation has really hit. Everybody, eh, especially with gas, which I know is stabilizing a little, but now that we're expected back in the office three days a week, it's just something to consider because we haven't heard much about. Raises recently and that's just. Where we are right now. Um. Everyone seems like happy they they don't. No one seems to want to leave. Happy might not be the right word, but everyone seemed satisfied with the job. They just like maybe a little more recognition of what they're doing and how their work is being valued.

"Hi, my name is Haley. Ah, my favorite food is cake. I've been a Hobey Baker for four years and I've made over 100 cakes for different occasions. The first step to making a cake is preheating the oven, per the recipe, and you want to make sure your oven has been preheating for at least 30 minutes so that it's at a consistent temperature. The next step would be to align your cake pans with parchment paper so they don't stick to the bottom when you need to remove them from the pan. Next, you'll want to make the cake batter and fill the pans up only halfway. That way, when the cake rises, it doesn't overflow and spill into the oven. Next you want to bake the cakes and then let them cool so you can remove them from the pans. Once the cakes are cool, you can make your icing per the recipe that you'd like to follow. And once the cakes are completely cool, you can alternate layers of cake and icing. If your cakes aren't completely cool, then the icing will melt and your cake won't stand upright. Once you have alternating layers of cake and icing, you can ice the perimeter of your cake and the top. And then smooth it out so that it's smooth and looks clean. And then after that it's just up to you with whatever decorations you'd like to put on your cake. I usually like to add extra frosting to make it really pretty and decorate for whatever occasion I'm celebrating.

At first, this doesn't seem like that big of an issue, but in America, one in three adults are overweight and there's an obesity epidemic within the country. If people started increasing their steps to the required 10,000 steps a day, maybe that could help solve part of the problem.

"OK, my topic today is how to wheelie a motorcycle. So it's a set of steps that you've got to go through. You can practice each one and then you put them together when you're doing awesome wheelies. One gotta cover the break. You gotta cover the rear brake with your right foot. You need to practice doing that. It's it's something that it's here, it's here. Emergency, right. If you overdo it, you hit that break. Front end comes down. If you really too high, too far, you're going to crash. You don't want to do that. You cover the break, so you tap the break in the middle of your wheelie. Bring the front wheel back down. Second step, you'll learn how to bounce. You stand up on the foot pegs hold onto the handlebars. You bounce the bike. You want to compress the springs. Bike goes down, then I'll come back up. You practice that. On the rebound when the bike is coming up, hit the gas, used the throttle, front wheel come off the ground. Just practice getting the front wheel off the ground and keep doing that. Remembering to keep back brake covered. Next step. Right it you gotta get that front wheel off the ground. Lean back, you give it some gas and you'll you'll ride along on one wheel. But as long as you want, if you feel like you're getting out of control, you hit that back brake. Front end comes down, bobs your uncle. Just keep practicing. Practice makes perfect.",5.0
"Thanks for having me here today. You asked me to talk about. The org changes we've had in services in APJ over the last year, so that's what I'm here to talk about. The probably most impactful thing to cover off is the fact that we have a new CX. Chief customer officer CSO Emily Mcevilly left in the start of the fiscal year and she's been replaced by Cherie Rhoades or former CIO. That that's a pretty impactful change. I think Sherry brings a very different approach, strong focus on data and analytics, focused on efficiency and you know, frankly, uh, reprioritization of a number of things that we do relative I think to to Emily's approach. So that's uh. A pretty big change that's filtering down through the broader CX organization specifically in APJ, we've got new field services leader, I think you all new TomTom has left.

"Morning, everyone. I want to talk today about education, specifically the cost of getting a college education versus the value of that education. To the students who receive it first, on the cost side, I think we've got um. Many decades of information now showing very high growth in cost of obtaining an education, a college degree. And, you know, it's really hard to understand to what end, you know, what's the. What's the what's the where's the money going? Why is it costing so much more year after year to get a college degree? Why is the cost of providing that education increasing the way it is? It seems unclear, seems to be fed by an attitude that it's always worth it no matter what to get a college degree, and by essentially limit, seemingly limitless. Um. Subsidies in the forms of federally backed student loans. But. It to what end? You know what? What are you getting out of it? What are we getting out of it as a society? Why are we spending so much money collectively on college educations? You know, I think it's not clear. It will guarantee you a great income, a great job. There's more and more risk as student loans become. Uhhh, unforgivable. In in bankruptcy court and and other things. It it just really strikes me that. There's there's a lack of. Viability in the trend that we're on, the sustainability of the cost of a college degree relative to what you get from it.

And I always felt like I was pretty inclined mechanically, but also really liked working with people. I found a engineering degree that helped me work with people as well and I wanted to stay local so I chose University of Cincinnati and they had a Co-op program with their engineering program. So one of the companies that came on campus was GE Aviation and I ended up doing my. I end up doing my Co-op program with GE. Um, I didn't finish my career with GE. I left, went, did a couple other things, and. Eventually found a additive manufacturing company that I wanted to work for and I was there for several years working in operations. And that company eventually got bought out and I came back to GE. So back to GE, I was in operations, still working through additive manufacturing, working on some of my leadership skills and then. I decided that or realized that I had a problem, a blind side to some of the quality. So I worked to find a quality roll and networked into that and now I'm in a customer quality position too long.",4.0
"Hi, good morning. Patrick Schmitz here. So today I want to teach you how to make one of my favorite dishes, fan favorite. I call him Skyline balls. So first, what we're going to do is we're going to turn on our deep fryer. We want that at about 350 degrees. It's going to take a little bit of time to warn up, warm up. So we're going to go ahead and turn that on. Now the second thing we're going to do is get one package of cream cheese and we're going to set that out and let it come up to room temperature if it's soft. And it's going to be a lot easier to work with. Then we're going to go ahead, get about 16 ounces of. Cheddar cheese, and we're going to grade that either coarsely or finely, doesn't really matter. And then finally we've got the actual Skyline chili itself. So pretty simple recipe. We're going to take the cream cheese, the Cana skyline chili and the grated cheddar cheese, and we're going to mix those all together, right? So mix that in a bowl, get it very, you know, it's going to be very thick and lumpy when you're finally finished with it. Once you've got that, go ahead and take that and set that aside. Now we're going to open. The won ton wrappers, so you've got little wonton wrappers about this big. You're going to lay them out in a pattern where all the edges are touching, and if you have a little brush with some water, you're going to brush that on. And then that's going to help it all stick together. So you want to take about 1 teaspoon, put it in their, fold it up and crimp all the edges so nothing comes out once you fold all of those up. Put them all on a tray and let him dry. Finally, we're going to put that in the deep fryer for about 10 seconds and enjoy.",4.0

"Hi I am Ben Patterson. I work at GE Aviation in the Wilmington plant location. I work for these schools department both LEAP X and small schools um. I want to say that I've been in the machine industry about six years or so. Um originally was working in the customer service industry and while I enjoyed it and did well at it. It wasn't that challenging and also it. The financial benefits were excellent, so I decided to go back to school. Um went to the local Community College, offered a trade program associates in applied science for. Machining. So I took the course and more I was doing that got eh apprenticeship at a local machine shop. Um. I have been working on my skill set continually. Continually trying to develop that um. So yeah, just been working in the industry for probably four or five years, got the apprenticeships are working and got to a point where I was writing in C code every single day. Things will change rapidly on a daily basis, so it was a great time for personal development and sharpening and polishing the skill set. Um, recently, I want to say about seven months ago, I've started out at General Electric. It's a great company to work for, a lot of benefits with a great work environment, um, so I'm really happy to be out there. I feel like I made a great choice on the industry I decided to go into isn't going away anytime soon. You know as much as our. Cultural moves into a digital age. We will still need the physical components to live our lives made, so it's not going anywhere. We still need to fly, still need things. Um, so yeah, that's basically.

"Hi, my name is Ben Patterson. Um, today I would like to speak to you about CNC machining. Um. It has been around, I want to say, for about 80 years or so. Um, it was initially invented to cut complex aircraft parts. Um, I think it was generated or was created rather at the. Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Um, maybe it was created around 1957. The early machines used um tapes prior to the days of the modern computer as we think of it now. The points like the XYZ, the movements in the feed rates were all stored on a tape that was fed into the machine to actually ate the tools to cut um. So that was a huge advent as far as saving time in machining, allowing more complex parts to be machined. Um. You could allow you know something that would take one guy all day to do one operation. Now you could have one guy that runs the string of machines while. You know, during or doing another associated process with that um. So it is definitely been a huge advancement. Um has allowed. Us to utilize new materials, new geometry, all kinds of things in the manufacturing industry. Um. See you. You know, after that time, um. Computer numerically controlled machines came into prevalence, so you did not need the tape anymore for the machine, which even further increase the capability um. So it definitely was a huge game changer for the world of manufacturing and we're still even seeing developments to this day as far as additive manufacturing, um, how it could change the future of those world.

"Today I will be talking about integrations in good day work day.

So what we do is we actually connect work day to any went to any systems that the client wants. Um, that the client wants to keep. So for example, if the client wants to keep their payroll system, what we have to do is we have to come in and we have to basically build a bridge between work date and between their other third party systems. So few things that you have to make sure is firstly we have to make sure that. Weather do they accept the the format of the data that work? They even transfers between that work they can produce in order to send out to the vendor systems. Most of the time it's possible, but then there have been few scenarios in which we have had to cater to other other means by which we can send the data out to the vendor systems. So always make sure rule #1 before building the bridge, we have to know what are we building the bridge for? What are the needs for the bridge? What should the bridge do? When we say what should the bridge to that means we're all data they need for us to send to them and how the data or and how the things that the other system needs, what sort of format that work they should be delivering it to them um.

The third phase which is basically their development, AH, configure and prototype phase is the phase in which the actual development starts. The development of the tenant, the configuration, the integration development, all the technical things, all that takes place in the configuring prototype phase. The fourth phase, which is basically the testing phase is in vain is is when the clients get involved and they start testing.

I am now responsible for pitching. New business, so I'm hoping one of the five um will finally move us to final rounds and select this as their new agency of record in the New Year. So my goal is to build a new team and to start from the ground up and retain them for over a year. And to do this, it really requires us over delivering on whatever scope of work we sign with any of these five businesses. And then internally it's about getting buy in from any of the people that I'm direct reporting, um. And getting them comfortable with our ways of working, understanding what the clients needs are and then letting them act autonomously outside of my purview.

And it's actually taking on the roles and responsibilities of see in many ways and engaging these clients without my supervision, which has been really key clearing up my time. Personally, she came from a background of another market agency, so she does have experience, so I do believe that. She's one of the people that we are seeing as a potential future Rockstar around the organization and has the potential for high growth as we give her more responsibility. I think with the right amount of coaching and kind of feedback around small projects, we could be able to craft something that's really, really special. That's going to be important and a lifeblood for our business moving forward. Our own personal life. She currently lives in Tacoma, which is done outside the city, so this whole hybrid return to work.

"One thing I think we need to be spending a lot more time on. Focusing. Is the influence or impact social media has had on the human race.

"Do you want to play the fastest growing sport in America? The answer is yes, then the sport pickleball is for you. It's a competitive, fast-paced, fun and exciting game that is sweeping across the country. Let me tell you how it's played. There's a complete be played with two people or four people, one person on each side of a court. That is very similar to a tennis court, but a little bit smaller. It starts off with one person serving diagonally across to the other team. That other team needs to hit the ball back. In return it to the serving team. From there, the teams hit the ball back and forth until somebody scores a point. The way you score a point is by either the other team hitting it out of bounds or into the net. Very similar to tennis as well. There's also a little bit of a difference between tennis, because this court is much smaller and there's an area called the kitchen which you are not allowed to step into. The kitchen can only be stepped into. Unless the ball. Balance is in the kitchen. You cannot hit the ball out of the air if you are in the kitchen and that results in the other team scoring a point. The reason I love this game so much is because it's very fun to play with friends. It doesn't require too much movement or exercise. And it gets my competitive juices flowing. I strongly encourage you to get out there and play people.",7.0

"So one of my favorite foods that I've been having since I was little that my mom always used to make was chicken pot pie. It was always a very special thing that we'd have for like birthdays or different like after big events and stuff like that, like graduations. And the way that you make it is one. You buy rotisserie chicken from Costco, which is nice because they're super cheap, but you take that chicken, you get all the meat off the bones and everything, and then you make a Russo. How you do that is you take. A couple of tablespoons of butter and then a couple tablespoons of flour. You add it to a Dutch oven and you put those on heat and stir them around until it starts bubbling um, and then you add milk. I have a dairy allergy so I use almond milk for this and I add in the almond milk and you stir it continuously. You want to make sure that it's on the lower heat so that it doesn't sear the rue and then what will happen is it will slowly start to come together and thicken up um. After that, I like to go in with some vegetables. I could, um, cut up some fresh vegetables, but it's much easier and honestly tastier to use, like a frozen faction pack of carrots, peas in um, green beans and corn. You add that in and what's really nice is that, um, the frozen vegetables have water in them. So it'll actually water down the sauce a little bit, which you need because honestly, I don't have that much milk. Um. And then after that you add in the chicken, you could get for a little bit um and then after it's like pretty um. Cooked, you take a baking pan, you put the ingredients into the pan, um, that add-on puff pastry that's premade, and then you put that in the oven at probably about like 400 for 20 minutes, and then until the crust is golden brown and that's it.",5.0

There's two museums that have different types of arts, and they have modern art and classical art that are really exciting to go see. They have fun tours to go on those. In addition, there's a bunch of historical places like Plaza my or.

So it's been nice to be on such a low level that were literally manufacturing parks and it feels like I can actually make an impact as opposed to just reporting things up and being kind of the middleman for it. And in terms of things that I think we could improve on is because we're not based in the main site. Cincinnati, Um, we can feel a little bit siloed. Sometimes. My team is about three or four people, three people.

Those are preconfigured delivered integrations that we recommend to use on every deployment.

They are able to self sustain themselves and they are able to troubleshoot any issue that will come in those integrations. The second tier of integrations is what we consider medium complex integrations. Those are the integrations that require both some logical and configuration experience partnered with development experience. Usually in that pattern we see a pattern of integrations where we are combining. Two integrations together, whether that's a connector with the document transformation or a connector with the studio or a document transformation by itself. The third tier of integrations is the studio integrations. Those are the most complex integrations and require a lot of development experience. We usually don't recommend for customers to build those integrations and we usually engage Workday certified consultants to deliver those integrations. Those integrations are complicated and post go live, the customer is responsible for maintaining them by themselves.

"Alright, I'm here to explain to you today how to on board consultants into a project for work day. First thing you need to do is have your project plan explaining exactly what you need to your resource manager or work day and they will get you first of all the resources and you need to match that to experience and what's required for the project. Once you've got your consultant you need to create an RPL within the project management software and then allows. You and the resource manager to get that consultant into the project. Once they're there, then they can start building and you also have to develop a forecast for the for the forecast, what you want to do is rely on your experience and what you've done in the past, and you also want to dab not to whatever is required for the project. So you'll create a forecast for them. Once that's done, you need to obviously speak to your consultant and they will also fill in the blanks. View in terms of any kind of vacation they have coming up, how many hours they can actually supply to the project and that all needs to be tweaked as well within the forecast. Once you've got that done, you also need to get them into project meeting. So you'll have a weekly internal meeting, you'll have meetings with the client, so you'll have to work with the customer PM to set those up as well. And they will also need certain accesses to smartsheet etc. So they can build out. Ornaments. This is specific as well to integration. Consultants will need to have an integration trucker and in that tracker they will stipulate which integrations or moving forward, due dates, etc. So that's how you get a consultant on boarded into work day. There's a lot of steps, but once they're there, they're there and then they can proceed and do the project as planned. Thank you.",8.0
"Hi, thanks for coming to today's topic is how to prepare for a steering committee meeting. This is one of the most important meetings that you will have with your customers and it's incredibly important to make sure that you're the information you're telling is at the executive level because you're going to have executives at this meeting. So you want your presentation to be well thought out, done in advance and then it's not a surprise. So before the steering committee meeting, you should. Definitely have spoken to your PM counterpart at the customer and the status of the project should be well known as well. So you should not go into that meeting with a project that is thought of as being green and then suddenly it's red. So these discussions need to happen before the steering Committee meeting so that everyone is on the same page as to status of project and there's no surprises. So things that are very important to go over during. These meetings is the work day methodology, so a good understanding of what methodology is being used throughout the project and confirm that the executives understand this. Also, you need to have a concise view of the project timeline so that the executives know exactly where you are in the project. And at what stage are evaluating, then you need to have a summary of what the project is doing. So of the stage that you're in, the milestones you're expecting to hit and what the requirements of the executive is to sign off on for that stage. So you always want to make sure that they're signing off on the milestones that you're in for that particular stage. That's very, very important. Finally, you want to look. At the training that they've done to make sure that the training is up to date and the financial position as well. So you have a forecast what invoices have been paid and after that they'll have a good summary of where you are in the project. Thank you.",6.0
"I am here today to talk to you about the most important thing. When planning a steering committee meeting, the first thing you need to do is make sure you align with your customer PM on exactly what the status of the project is. So if you both think it's green, great. If you don't think it's red, great. But that needs to be aligned before the steering committee meeting happens. Once the steering Committee meeting is there, you need to get the executives to sign off on the stage that you're in. And they need to understand exactly what milestones are signing off on. So during the meeting, you're going to have a summary slide where these milestones are presented. You want to get a coordinated response from the executives as to, yes, those have been delivered. That should all be in your notes beforehand. And then you're going to send them a summary e-mail to say what you've discussed and that they actually agree that those milestones have been accomplished during the meeting. Thank you.",
"Hi, thank you for joining me today. I want to speak to you all about renewable energy, which is one of the most important things that our planet is currently facing, renewable obviously in order to. Make our cities work, make all your cars work, etc. This is an incredibly important topic and must be addressed as immediately as one of the major concerns of the human population. So for years we've use fossil fuels, gas and all that, as we know today, is creating havoc in the environment, in terms of pollution, in terms of human health, etc. So one of the things we need to focus on in. Immediately is to get renewable energy, renewable energy source that is both safe and efficient for the world moving forward. So up until now the options that we have have been rather mid term successful, but we do have some good options. One of the ones actually in our province of Quebec is the hydroelectric power, so using. The rivers to move the turbines and collect energy, and it's also been proven to be over the years, very safe. Obviously you need to have the rivers and all of the terrain in order to do that, so it's not for everyone, but this is an excellent choice also in terms of potential future ones, as nuclear fusion hasn't been figured out yet, but solar power and using panels, if we can get the battery storage to be better, it's. Also an excellent option and one that the world is pushing forward right now. So these are some amazing options and some reasons to be positive about what's coming up in the future for renewable energy and the human race. Thank you.",5.0
"I'm here to talk to you today about the fact that Michael Jordan, Star basketball player that we all know, squirt almost 33,000 points in his career. That's in saying, like, I think I've been my whole life, I've scored maybe 20 baskets. But I mean, I don't play basketball, but still. But just like nuts. I mean if you think about this #33,000, that would be like if we divine that by a number of days in a year, 33,000 / 365. That's nine years. So if you score one basket every day of your life from infancy on, that would take you 90 years, which is just nuts. So incredible accomplishment by Michael Jordan probably will never be matched again. And it just shows that what, ah, amazing athlete he was and star player for that people will be talking about for years and years and generations to come. Thank you.",4.0

There's some great tips that I want to share with you about being prepared and successfully packing your bags and hitting the road without any stress or added turmoil. I had the opportunity to be gifted some packing bags. Compression bags there have a lot of names, but they're the bags you put your things in. You put it inside your suitcase and it helps you keep things organized. The best thing about these bags is you can put things in EMM, squish him down, get a lot in there and quickly throw them in your bag. I typically use one bag when full-sized bag to pack my clothes. And here's a tip, roll your clothes really tight and you'll fit a lot more in that packing cube. I use another one to pack all my intimate apparel, making sure I have everything ready and leave the bags in my suitcase. They're ready to pack. Can get them in there quickly. Those two items paired with a great suitcase. I prefer the ones that opened. This way you get to pack both sides. It's easy to get them organized, easy to unpack. Pull things together that and invest in a great bathroom bag. One you can hang on the wall includes all the things you need and is easy to put together. All of those items combined make for a quick stress feed. Way to pack your bag and hit the road for a trip without any extra stress. I hope it's helpful.",7.0
"We all know companies want to be profitable. Of course they do. That's why they exist. But I love working for a company that values things other than profitability. Things like employees. Fun customer service. Our customers are the best thing we have in it. What is what makes us profitable. There are other values or innovation. I love that we are continuing to innovate, making a product better, bringing better value to our customers. What better thing do we have to offer? And all of this we wrap in a wrapper of integrity. We worked for a company that expects us to. Mean what we say? And do what we mean. We want to stick to our commitments and make sure that we are feeding our customers great value and setting them up for a long term relationship. We talk about fun. Love fun, right? Fun and employees. It's such a special thing that work day has these two items as part of their values. Means their employees are important. They treat us well while they hold us. To a high standard, they also show that were of high value. What could be better than that as an employee of a growing company? And all of that wrapped in a wrapper of fun. Fun takes the shape of maybe contests. It might be special gift sent your way that you run expect not expecting. It might be a nighttime cantina on Friday after a long days work.

They're not just out there to create a profit, which is one of their key values. But they also value a lot of other things that make for happy employees and happy customers. Some of the other core values that work Day has is that their employees are the center of their company. What is a company if it doesn't have great employees? How do you get great employees? You expect integrity. Be sure that we are meaning what we say and say what we mean. All of that is paired with certainly customer service. We want to keep our customers happy.

"When I say education, what do you think of ice? Eh, education, you say? School, I bet. Teachers, maybe. I'd like to think that education is so much more than. The standard education we think of on a day-to-day basis. We all raise our kids, we get them ready, look forward to that first day of school and off we send them. Then we can't wait for them to graduate. I'd like the world to think about education and a much broader sense. Think about everybody is being a teacher. I so often hear my daughter, she'll say mom. Why didn't school teach me this? As she learns about budgets, mortgages, investments, car insurance, all of these things that. We don't really think of as part of our educational system. We think everybody knows this. But think back, how did you learn all of these things? I bet you had a parent. Maybe a grandparent, maybe a friend, maybe you stumbled. Think of all of us as being part of the educational process, making sure that everyone around us has an awareness of not only academic education, but also those things that make our kids successful every single day. Having kids that know how to manage their bank. How to work with the bank? How to find a bank, even pick a bank. Think of these things. So I would like to advocate that our world should look at education not only as how do we get our kids to school? How do we teach them history? How do we teach them to read? How do we teach them math and different things, but think about the real skills that are going to make them so successful as they grow older and become our peer citizens in the world we live in.",7.0

I think we have players that we look back in the past and they have just a few 1000. Points that they've scored, but 33,000 points? That's amazing. He really brought basketball to life for a whole new generation of fans. Thanks, Michael Jordan, 33. Wow.",7.0
"Hi. After 26 years, I made a big choice, left my career, chose not to retire 'cause I wasn't old enough and ended up at work day. People often ask why work day? Why would you choose to leave your career, move on to something so different and start over at your age? Well, work Day is a proven leader in. Developing ERP or enterprise wide applications that support employees and financials. It's an exciting place to be unlike other ERP programs. They take one system and provide it to their employees to use for everything that they need instead of having to go to different systems and do different tasks. Work days. A company is such a pleasure to work for, they really value their employees. Customer service is top notch and one of their core values, they looked to be innovative. It's one of the things I really enjoy is always having something new. They have great integrity and they hold their employees to high integrity. I'd like to strive to that on every day I have a chance. And profitability of course, is one of their values. We want to continue to be a developing company and continue to grow, but most of all. They include fun as one of their core values. They provide great opportunities to their employees and their customers to be great partners and provide them away.

"How I ended up in this career, it was by coincidence actually. By academics, I have studied financials. I really hated it and I was related, but I never wanted to practice finance. I started as a purchaser. A packaging buyer in the food industry. I really love this job. I thought I would do my entire career into purchasing, but finally I am. I am a marketing and communication manager. I ended the ER step-by-step after purchasing packaging. I purchased services, marketing services and then I did marketing itself and then after marketing added marketing communications and this is how I ended into marketing communications moving from. Purchasing to marketing to communications. It was a long journey I have to say, and I could do this this move by meeting people. I ended up as a marketing communications manager. Songs to the people I have met through the journey. My first manager first recruited me and trusted me into purchasing. Then another manager approved that I moved to marketing. On trusted me. I could do the change from purchasing to marketing. It was a big step, I have to say. And last but not least, I was recruited by Mark as a communication manager. Coming from the furniture industry, they trusted I had marketing skills and that I could use them into a communication rule. So I finally ended up into marketing communications by coincidence by meeting different people who trusted trust me all along my professional journey. I am grateful to all those people.

"Hi. The topic I want to talk about today that is near and dear to my heart and I think it's more. Central and so fundamental. To any issues out there, it's kind of the chicken and the egg thing. This is the one thing that is the chicken is at the egg. It doesn't matter. I think it's it. And I think is is that it's education. It has been written many, many times and by many, many people about democracy. That if you don't have an educated voter bank in today's voting day. You're going to have. Some real issues about how people make their decisions. If they're not thoughtful, if they're not critical, if they don't have good reading comprehension, they are going to be prey to people. Who are going to be snake oil salesman? They're going to play to their fears. You needed discerning group to say I hear ya, but that's ********. Also, you know, it's one of those things too is how do people grow? How do they grow and become and better themselves without education and. You're not going to solve any problem 0 problems if the people don't know how to think or know how to research or know how to go and problem solve. So that's the essential thing about education. It is the bedrock, and I mean the bedrock for solving any problem. And it's also shown through the years is that it's part of equality. If if you don't get an education, at least a really good base education, you cannot grow as a person, you cannot participate in society, and you're always going to be. The person who serves others and that served yourself. So that's my opinion about education. So I. I hope you enjoyed it.",4.0

"I want to talk about today some lawn mowing techniques that I use to get a great line and they have it the envious lawn of all your all your neighbors. The first thing I do is I when I look at my lawnmower I flip it over and I make sure that my equipment, in this case the lawnmower blade is the sharpest possible. And also just if you have a sharp blade then you'll cut the grade of the blade of grass. Cleanly, and you'll be have a much better looking lawn. You'd be amazed of what that would look like. You know, just just doing that will help with the lawn. The greatness of your lawn. After you've completed that, what I would recommend is to, when you're mowing the lawn, to do a perimeter at least two times all way around the area of that of your lawn. Area at least two times at least go three. And the reason I do that is so that when you're going up and down the lawn you're able to have an area that's already been cut and. The grass doesn't get split spew out all over the place when you are mowing the lawn. The next item that you're doing when you're going up and down, take your time. Yeah, if it's uh, if your grass is longer, you want to make sure that you're not rushing the lawnmower through the area that you're mowing. This way the blade, the blade has enough time to cut as wanted. Once you're done with that, I would go ahead and get your trimmer and trim all way around all the long edges to make sure that that is completed. And then lastly, what I would do is also probably go. On the opposite side that you were running, I would run the lawnmower again so that you could have a very clean and grade looking line. That is my recommendation to get a great line.",3.0
"The name of the game is passive income and how I do it is through Airbnbs. Airbnbs, you think of it being passive as far as a way to obtain that passive income, but really I would say it's kind of sub passive if you will. It's really like you're running a hotel and in that particular case you have to have the right, you're right hotel staff available um so that your your small business, in this case you rarbg run smoothly. In in the case for me, I have the eh cleaning crew that I have to think about so that when guests come in and check in and check out that they come in and clean and do the laundry and so forth. So I'm talking about the laundry. There's a lot of laundry there. If you have, in my particular case, I have 4 bedrooms, that's four beds that you have to change out when a guest comes in and out of the. Of the house that I have in particularly for the Airbnbs. So you have to think about the amount of laundry that you have for this. And then secondly, who's going to do all the communication for the bookings of that. So in that particular case, the bookings as far as people wanting to book in, but it's really those questions that you get any concerns if there's any damage. So you do have to spend time for that person that's going to be the reservation or customer service person that you're going to have. So it's very far from being passive income in the sense that. We were, you know, you are getting that passive income in your daily life, but it is really a lot more work than you would normally have if it was going to be from just a normal rental where you're just collecting your monthly rental income and just fixing the issues that you have. So passive income, that's the name of the game. Airbnbs is how I do it, but it's not as passive. But you was think. Thank you.",3.0
"Are Airbnbs truly a way for passive income? Well, I don't know about that. There's a lot that goes into an erbb, things that you don't think about on uh, you know, it sounds great to get that extra money. However, is it truly passive in the sense that you are doing a lot more work than you would normally with pink? Those items that would include cleaning services, the communication, booking, you know damages, um, may just daily maintenance. So yeah, is it passive income? Yes, it is passive income. However, it's a lot more challenging that it would be just for a normal rental. Um, where you would just. Obtain the rental income on a monthly basis. So think about it. It's not as passive as you think, but it's a good opportunity.",
"How do we solve the world's problems? Well, in my mind, it's education. Education is truly the key to success. Having education globally will help with poverty. Um, you know our food crisis is um, have an opportunity to. Um, allow people to have better jobs. And also to solve a lot of the world's problems. The challenging thing with education is that it's not. Clearly available to everybody and and in the United States there is a large number of individuals that don't have the same opportunities just based off of where they live in the neighborhoods or school districts that they live in. Um, and that is the biggest challenge for our country in the United States and I would assume globally as well. We need to focus on giving a fair and equal opportunity for education so that we could all participate in in in this world's economy and as well as solve some of the world's biggest problems, not only just in the United States but also throughout the whole world. Um. When we have education, we're allowed to. Better technology and solve some issues perhaps with, even if with global warming and things of that nature so. I think that when I say education is truly the key to success, it is it is the key to success for for not just only us in the United States, but for everybody in the whole world. Education is really a pathway for us to continue our existence in my mind, in this world.",3.0
"Did you know that in 500 BC, 40% of all of all land was owned by women? That's unheard of in today's world. Why do you think that's the case? Well, let's think about it. In 500 BC, Sparta was a very warrior based. Um, land. And most of the men would go out. Well according to the movies, would go out and fight other warring tribes. And so it just made sense that the women would be the land owners and they also tended to the land.

This may mean acting with integrity with a client and justice taking the next right step. And not obsessing over how the client will receive. That action. Another aspect of more of Stoicism is what they call meditating on your mortality. It's about making sure your values are aligned with your life today, if your values are about having enough time to spend with your family every night. That means you shouldn't be working till midnight every night. Stoicism is extremely applicable to the workplace and to every aspect of your life.",7.0

"Hi, I'm here to tell you about my mother-in-law's famous Italian red sauce. It all starts off with a few glugs of olive oil where we saute 3 to 4 garlic cloves that had been minced. Then we take two to three cans of eight ounce passata, which is our homemade jcard tomato sauce, which is from the garden as well. Once we add that in there, we spice it with some basil. Some salt and pepper. As we mix it around, we get it to a boil. And leave it covered almost all the way, but just leave a little bit sometimes. Will often put a wooden spoon right in between the lid and the actual pot and let the steam get out of the pot that way. That helps the sauce come up to a boil and cook all the tomatoes that are in there. And we do that for about 1/2 hour. Then afterwards we add some water, equal parts to the amount of sauce that we put in there, and then we let it simmer uncovered for two to three hours. After all of that time. Will put in some meatballs or maybe some pork and sauteed into first saute the pork into separate pan, add it into the sauce and what will happen is that meat will fall off the bone and will enrich the sauce and will sometimes call it gravy once we had the meat in there. So it's sort of a red gravy, not brown, but it is something that we hold dear to, to call it that with the sauce will often make macaroni or pasta depending on. What you call it and oftentimes we have homemade cavatelli, which is a small little piece of pasta that is similar to. No key, but not potato.

"I'm here to tell you how payroll accounting works in our work day environments. First, let's start off with positions. All workers have a position in work day in that position contains lots of data. Contains their FCE, contains what pay rate types they have, hourly or salary. But it also contains some costing instruction that we use for our accounting processes. The three main organization types that we tide to positions our company cost center and fund. And those three values are called costing organizations as they deliver the accounting instruction for our liabilities to calculate as part of the payroll accounting process. That is to say that as payroll calculates and we're posting payroll journals work these taking the positions that's being used in our payroll calculation and using those three values and attaching to journalize associated with our liabilities that could be things like federal withholding, state withholding and a slew of other deductions. I keep saying we're back. And my, um, youth OK, we're back. On the other hand, pardon that pause. Uh, we have expenditures and. Our customers don't generally prefer to use our default organization assignments on positions to inform work these accounting engine for expenditure. And we have a process called costing allocations which is our customers way of being able to add funding logic to our positions. So as a worker reports time or how salary associated with their position those hours and those amounts for expenditure or using the costing allocation values which are a little more complex and that could also include things like programs, projects. Grants and other accounting dimensions that again would inform the apparel accounting process and how to calculate expenditure.

"Hi, here's a quick one minute rundown of payroll accounting and work day. Let's start with the two main Ledger account types, expenditure and liabilities. Let's go down to liabilities. Liabilities use your position organization assignments to derive its accounting logic. On every position. We generally put company cost center in a fund and these values are what informed your accounting process to derive those work tag values and associate them to that journal. Now let's talk about expenditures. Expenditures a little more complicated. We have a concept of payroll costing allocations and work day and that is a way to override those defaults organization values. So even though you have a home cost center and home fund in home company, we can override those values for date frames and using percentage distribution to inform your expenditure how to cost. We also love for work tag override with time entry. And that's thank you for listening. That's our quick rundown of payroll accounting. Er.",
"I have many concerns with renewable energy. Natural resources, or just that natural and they're finite? And the idea of using solar and electricity. Makes much more sense in the long term, however. Technology as of today in terms of battery technology still isn't up to par to my standards and I don't think it's up to part of the worldwide standard. Unfortunately, the materials used in making lithium ion batteries or rechargeable batteries that we find electronic vehicles for example, or in homes that have battery powered solar. Are using minerals that are generally mined from slave labor both in Asia and in Africa. I don't think that these miracle industries should be using slave labor to build their products, much like iPhones are generally using minerals that are mined in awful, awful working conditions that I don't think should be replicated in other industries. Unfortunately, having a smartphone has become a necessity in today's world in those that don't have it or pretty much forgotten about, so I can imagine that the next step is though is that don't have an electric vehicle or solar. Or battery powered homes will be in the same boat, but unfortunately for me, I'm not a fan of funding those types of terroristic in slave forced labor environments. Let alone the pollution that these batteries 'cause. They're not recyclable and they're filled with plenty of materials that don't, or corrosive and complete drinking water supply as well as crop, excuse me, crop.

Why is it important to have a proven methodology, a proven way to implement our system and how can a client become a trusted partner at work day? One of the most important things we need to do is to learn how to use the methodology. When people come to work day, what we do is we teach them. Our methodology are 4 stages and it's very important that we learn from that. We have our planning stage, we have to plan, we have to make sure we were ready for this large deployment. We then have an architect and configure stage where we actually work with the customer, we get their requirements and we start to then configure work day. We then have the customers test and after they test, we move on to deployment by using our proven methodology. What we will do is you will learn, you will be able to execute and ultimately be successful at work day. Work Day has been able to prove that our methodology works time and time again.

For scalability, our methodology is 4 different stages and I'd like to explain them. The first one is planned. It's very important that we plan, we make sure that we are ready for our deployment, that we have done a full project plan that we know that we can execute with staffing also too that the customer and work they have agreed that this plan works. Also during this we also do all of our initial configuration for what we call a foundation tenant services build and that's all done during our plan of deployment. The next thing we have is architect and configure. We need to make sure that we understand what the what the customer wants. We all have an Esso W statement of work that explains it all, but we have to make sure that we align this Esso W with the clients requirements. Once we have those requirements, we then will start what we call configuration that is taking work day and making it for what the customer wants. After we complete that process, there is an extensive testing process that we do as well. We ask our customers to test every single piece of the system they are implementing. That is a long process, but very important. And like we said, we test from soup to nuts, the overall process. The last thing we do is deploy.

The first one is planning, making sure that we're ready for our deployment, that we know how we're going to implement it, we know what the project plan is, and we know how to make sure that we can be successful.

"OK. So today I will talk about a work related topic. The first thing I want to say is that when we work with clients, they can be fun, there can be a challenging, they can be very difficult to work with. So what I want to talk about is all those categories of different type of clients we have again challenging challenge clients, we have very fun clients and those are really the two kind of things that you see. When you work with Pines, right, they can be found on the challenging. So when you have a fun client, you know, I think that we would be great to do is entertain their relationship, continue to build that relationship and make sure that they are referenceable, right. You have a client that you have an opportunity to do great work with. So embrace it and continue to elevate them, continue to bring them to the next level so that they want to participate more, they want to help you, they want to be a reference for you and then you're going to be very successful. With your next project and next clients, right? You don't want to think about this client only, but the next one and the next one and the next one. So when you have a phone plan to work with again maintain and entertain their relationship. If you have a challenging client, what you do is we find solutions because if you imagine, imagine a little bit if you can turn around that client 2 something that is. But if, then there will be your friends for life and there will be that firm client that you had before, right? So you want to make sure you look at the challenges and resolve them.

Now, it is not that easy, as I wish it was, but in order to be a good swimmer or actually if you're big enough, summer, whatever it is, basically the first, the first item to know is to not panic. If you panic, things are going to go wrong, right? So do not panic and stay calm and breathe. You know, if you don't breathe, obviously you're not going to go very well. If you do breathe is going to be OK. So breathe, um, you know, take your time. Breathe. Do not panic. Those are definitely the first item that I would tell you to do. If you are a beginner streamer. Basically, you know, take it easy, go into water, you know, you you just do a few things here and there, you know, and then you go into deeper poor as you progress. If you're a good swimmer, look at your technique. Technique could be different depending on what you want to improve. If you want to do maybe freestyle. You look at techniques and try to stretch your arms along bit longer, you know, to be able to have more length and then more power has you move your arm closer to you and under the water, trying to catch us more. Whatever you can. Try to stay, uh, bomb corner. Obviously try to stay um high underwater because they're less friction you have against the water. The more speed you will have, the easier it will be. But if you're underwater or too close to the surface of the water, you could have a lot of friction. The friction is going to slow you down. So if you want to improve your speed, try to stay on top of the water so you can glide and then stretch so that you have the least amount of resistance. So those are the tips to. Get to a better spot for swimming, whether you are beginner or advanced swimmer. Thank you very much. Sounds good.",5.0

And then when you have your next project then you try to make that phone as well. Not all clients are fun, that's for sure. We all know that. But if you can find a climate fund, keep dilation ship. If not, if you have a challenging we relationship with a client, a challenging project, or whatever it is, make sure you find solutions for them. If you can find solutions to their problems and you work hard at it, there will be come from challenging to more fun, right? And then uh, your friends for life.

This is a number that's near and dear to my heart as it's helped me a lot on my personal health and weight loss journey. During the pandemic, I started taking a piece of advice from a piece of software that was actually given to Aspire Insurance Company at work. He recommended I take 7500 steps today. What does that really mean though? What it means to me is a minimum of 250 steps per hour and taking a few. Mid length walks per day. This goal is much harder to hit if you try to do it all in one fell swoop. Certainly it's possible everyone likes to go on a hike every now and then or a longer walk, but it's much easier if you break it down into easy to digest pieces.

"When I was a kid growing up in the Chicago area, I was always fascinated by transportation, equipment and watching the trains go by. I never stopped being interested in that, and as I went through school, I continued to try to learn as much as I could about the transportation industry. When I first was able to obtain a camera, I started photographing transportation equipment, mostly shipping containers. As I tried out various educational and career paths, I always maintained an interest in transportation. And when I found the opportunity to join. Ocean shipping industry. When one formed in 2018, I was quick to jump at the opportunity. It was a good time to move my family back to Chicago and start new path. I had already been racking up transportation industry experience in the freight brokerage sector, but my interest remained in the ocean shipping sector most of all, being able to jump into this field that apply the knowledge I've learned and freight brokerage was very appealing to me and it's been very interesting and very rewarding to help guide one on the path from.

"Today we're going to talk about how to cook an easy fried rice. My favorite thing about this is that it can suit any pallet or any dietary restriction within reason. I personally like to add a lot of eggs and seafood to mine, but my girlfriend is vegan and it's easy to accommodate the recipe to her restrictions and tastes. The first thing we're going to need is a walk. And a little bit. Of comfort and know how with using it. If you don't have that, that's OK because we're going to gain it on the fly. I like to start with Trader Joe's frozen rice. There's either the Jasmine kind. The Japanese fried rice or the vegetable fried rice? If we're using the Jasmine kind will need a little bit of dark soy sauce. I like the Pearl River Bridge brand that's available at H Mart. Otherwise, we can just get started. Before we put the rice in though, what we're going to do is stir fry some veggies. I'd like to start with broccoli we can use. These are frozen or fresh, but in any case we want it cut into bite size pieces and we're going to stir fried broccoli with a little bit of sesame oil in the wok. And we're also going to put the lid on the walk, just for a moment to steam it. We don't want it to be too cooked through because we're going to add it back in with the rest of the rice later. Next we're going to do some tofu with a little bit more of the sesame oil and a little bit of the dark soy sauce. We're going to do it by itself. We're going to place the broccoli in the bowl next to us. After this, we're going to put the fried rice in. We're going to combine all the ingredients and we're going to stir fry it to our liking. Some people like it a little more well done, some people like it a little bit less crispy. That's completely tear taste. You can also alter this recipe to add or remove vegetables and proteins as you wish. I like to add some scallions, and I also like to add some heat when I'm finished. A little bit of hot oil, but it's completely up to you. I hope you enjoy the recipe. That's how we cook fried rice.",6.0

"Hi, my name is Scott Lopez. I'm a business analyst here at Ocean Network Express. I took a very roundabout way of getting here. I came out of high school, started in road construction. Shortly thereafter, I realized that the oldest person on my team was 28 and he was far too old to do the job, so I decided I should probably go to college. Um. Enrolled in college. Had an idea, had grandiose ideas of being on TV as a sportscaster. So that's what my education was mainly geared towards for the first, I don't know, year and a half or so. Um, after that I. Had bought a house and I realized I really, really needed to look into getting a real job. So I pivoted and ended up here at Ocean Network Express. More or less because I was working as a bartender and one of the people that came into the bar said that Ocean Network Express was hiring. That happened to be right around the time I was graduating college. So I joined as just a customer service representative. And. It's been nearly five years now. Since then I have gone to. A supervisor I transferred to another supervisor role and now I am over as a business analyst. Not only am I a business analyst, but I am a business analyst who thought that that talk would take about 15 to 20 more seconds.

"Hello, my name is Scott Lopez and my job here is to teach you something, anything, over the next two minutes and I am going to teach you how the option play works in American football. Now, over the weekend when I came up with this idea, I was under the impression that I would have a visual aid accompanying me, but that's fine. For the purpose of this video, I will just assume that. You are aware of the typical rules of a quarterback, running back, wide receiver in traditional football. So what the option play is, is unlike other structured place in the sportswear. Everybody has an assigned role. The wide receiver is going to run this way. Quarterbacks going to go left yadda yadda in the option play. The roles are not determined until the ball is hiked. So the running back maybe getting the handoff, he may not. He does not know until the quarterback makes the decision based on the defense. So essentially the quarterback is staring down the defensive end. If the defensive end crashes in, meaning he's going to go tackle the running back, then he pulls it back, does not hand it off if he goes outside. Then he does hand it off. And the second, the level to that is there is another running back coming around the outside. So if you do not hand it off as the quarterback, you still have the option of lateraling one more time. In case an outside guy is going to tackle you, that allows for three different outcomes on one single play, making it in my opinion. The best play in football. Thanks for your time.",5.0

"Good morning. As you have probably noticed throughout this course I have a number of guitars hanging in the background in my office here I often get asked what is the best way to learn. Should I learn on an electric guitar? Should I learn on an acoustic guitar? What do you recommend? And what I say to that is, it really depends on the type of music that you're looking to play. Right, so when I first started learning, I learned on the acoustic and what I found was it helped me to learn to be very particular, very distinct with my movements. If you hit a bad chord, hit string, have your finger down on the wrong fret right? It can cause a pretty big disturbance in your playing. You can hear it very audibly if you are learning on an electric and you're playing more of a distorted, rock'n'roll type of sound. Those little. Issues. Kind of get drowned out a little bit, right? So you don't hear him as much when there's distortion and you're playing loudly with lots of gain. So for me, it really is what? Do you like to play? What is your interest? Because it's probably a little bit harder to play the acoustic to make it sound good. It's probably a little easier to learn on the electorate. But if you want to play Dave Matthews Band doesn't make sense to learn how to play Slipknot, right? So that would be my suggestion for those learning guitar. Thank you.",6.0
"Hey, good morning. So for my 2 minute talk on eh work topic, what I'd like to talk about is my transition into my new role as a business technology liaison as opposed to my previous role as an operations manager within the trading services unit in purging.

You know growing A-Team and really career pathing them through their ascension here at Pershing. That is one of the things that drove me is a manager was really bringing in a talented. Candidate. Teaching them the role specific to our team and then helping them learn the additional functions, areas, items that will help them expand their their career here with Persian. So I don't get to do that as much anymore. I make it a point to continue on with the team, but in my new role I get to help drive the future state platform purging X trading and rebalancing platform. Very exciting, right? Today it's a lot of pulling down information, manually keying. Something in and then going back and you know, a lot of disparate systems in the future state. Much of this should be driven completely systemically by the system should.

With purging in my new role, I no longer have that sort of oversight on the team. What I'm doing now is really helping the platform mature and grow into what it needs to be right now. There is a lot of disparate systems that are all sort of being held together by different manual processes and different users in the future.

However much money goes in, there's, uh for many of these coins for Bitcoin, right, there's a limited amount. So the amount of money goes in divided by the number of bitcoins, right? You can figure out what the price will be, but the point is you can transfer assets between entities without a middleman. For years and years it's been banks, credit unions that really control that flow of assets. If I wanted to send money to my mother, I would send it through one of those intermediaries. And with digital assets, you no longer need that middle man. I could send a digital payment between myself to my mother without the bank in the middle controlling the flow of assets, right? It's all on one big electronic general Ledger, so everyone has. The ability to see these transactions, you know, who has ownership. It's a really exciting time to be involved and learn about these digital assets because I personally believe they are the future of money.",5.0
"So in 500 BC it was Aristotle that said that 40% of the land in Sparta was owned by women. This was very different than much of the other known areas at the time. Right in Greece, women could not own land. In Sparta, it was much more progressive. Women could own the land, however, if they come with some caveats. Right. Women did not have the ability to make their own decisions in regard to how that land is going to be utilized. They needed input from their husband and an heiress in order to make any sort of business transaction that was going to be. Worth more than a bushel of barley, right? So you have to take it a little bit with a grain of salt. However, it was very forward thinking of Sparta at the time to allow the women to own that property right. Men are off fighting the wars. We know the Spartan, the great heroes and fighters, so the women were at home tending to the farms. Learning how to deal with the different business transactions, but also taking care of everything while the men were away. Again, it came with stipulations, but it was really very progressive for the time.",6.0

Making big strides into the future. One of those strides is the purging X platform that I am working on currently with a number of folks from the product area. Right.

We want to configure that system with the configurations, the decisions that your investment managers are making, how you want your business to be managed. You set that up front.

And then there's food, cartoons, and if you cook at home then you have a whole bunch of paper towels and other things.

"I'd like a show of hands. How many of you have been assigned a project at work and said, Oh my God, I have no idea what I'm doing. Well that's what happened to me this past January when to any decided to get a new LMS system. We began by identifying the needs of the new system. At this time I had only been with ONE 90 days so I had no idea what they needed. Then we started down this RFI RFP process again, clueless on what those acronyms met, but they were looking for me for recommendations on what to do. A quick Google search and I figured out what the acronyms meant for the RFI process. We identified 6 different vendors and watch demos. Then we narrowed. Sat down and did the RFP process, which we asked for proposals. We selected one and thank goodness I wasn't the one that had to do the negotiation. Once we selected absorb for our LMS system, we immediately started having these calls on implementation and sister system configuration. Thankfully the BPT team got me at a consultant to help what it was, but again I was back to another Oh my God, what do we do? We started talking about 80P feeds and STI's and FPS. What in the heck is that stuff everyday I felt like my head. Was going to explode as we hit Roadblock after roadblock after Roadblock. As we started to see the light at the end of the tunnel, I started getting to work on the user in material. That was what I loved.

"Hi. I'm here to talk to you today about how I currently ended up in the role that I have professionally. I really kind of don't want to go backwards so far, but to kind of give you maybe the preview and a little bit of history for the past 10 years. So currently I work for Ocean Network Express as a business analyst and what I do there is basically I take. Business units that are currently operating throughout the entire department. And I get them together with it. Solutions to daily headaches, frustrations, pain points that they may be having with in their day-to-day operations. A business analyst can have a lot of functions and a lot of roles. You can facilitate meetings. You can write business specifications and plans. You can perform data analysis with visual models. I've always been interested in doing analysis of business functions. It seems that in my career I had always been able to find defects within the system. And kind of raised my hand to management to say if we could get this button push here to act in this function, we could eliminate waste with six additional steps to get to the same result. I've always been interested in innovation technology. I really do enjoy speaking with people about it. I'm not as technically savvy as I would like, but I am definitely on my way to becoming such.

"Hi and good day to you. Today I'm going to teach you how to make my favorite food, which is macaroni and cheese. Macaroni and cheese is my favorite food because it's delicious. It's really simple to make. You have to really put your effort into trying to do all of the ingredients from scratch. But once you put in all that effort and you bake your macaroni and cheese, it is the creamiest, cheesiest, homemade goodness that I can think of. So first, let me tell you what your ingredients are so that you can partake in chair. You need 2 eggs. You need. Two and maybe 1/4 cup of evaporated milk. I would say you need a half pound and a half of sharp cheddar cheese and you need a pound and a half of Colby Jack. That's a mixture. So it's Kobe and marry Jack altogether. Now I buy my cheese in blocks and I shred them. So you also need 2 cups elbow macaroni. You bring the water to a boil, OK, and a big stock pot. Put in a little bit of salt, just maybe. Couple pinches, maybe 1/4 salt you. Once it comes to a boil you add your noodles and you boil those about 8 minutes. Once the noodles are done you want to drain them. You want to add in your cheeses and then you in a separate bowl you add the two eggs in the evaporated milk. You mix that all together and you pour it on top of the cheeses and the noodles and you give it a good stir. I like to put a little salt and pepper on top and pepper Rica. For coloring and extra spice, set it in the oven for 3:50 for 40 minutes and serve. This is the best dish I've ever had in my entire life and hopefully it would be yours too.

There were no other birds around, just these two birds. When they got to the middle of the pond, both birds submerge themselves in water. I thought that was interesting, that maybe they would just take any bird bath, but come to find out they were to be underwater for an extensive amount of time. When they came back up, I decided to count. When they went back the second time, the first bird submerged after 20 seconds of holding his breath and the 2nd Berg after 25 seconds. This is amazing.

"So how I ended up at Ocean Network is actually a bit of an interesting little journey. I first started out at VCU as a chemistry undergrad and. When I was looking to move towards a pH D in chemical modeling and dissociation dynamics of different gas particles. I sort of had the feeling that I wouldn't be able to get into the career path that I truly wanted. So I moved into more of a legal subdiscipline of chemistry and did regulatory work for a couple of different companies, one that did water quality. Chemistries and one that did polyurethane foam chemistry is so if you've. Ever put down carpet and you've put down the? The padding that goes underneath that carpet, there's a very good chance if you're in the United States that I was helping to make sure that that was safe for you to use and that it was abiding by all of the government regulations. After that, because I had been in the regulatory space. I transitioned during the pandemic to Ocean Network Express and. In that, I utilized my knowledge of the Code of Federal Regulations, the CFR, and my ability to. Understand and apply that. To the different regulations and how those should be interpreted. And I was able to transition into a customs role for maritime transportation, specifically using the 19 CFR. And after about a year and a half of that, I decided. I really like data a little bit more, so with that I applied for a position as a data analyst and now I'm here very recently. Oh yeah, we're done. OK.",6.0

"If you've ever wondered how to make a proper French omelet, at least according to the French cuisine. This would be a very good time to learn. So what you're going to need is you're going to need approximately 3 eggs, a stove, a pan, preferably stainless steel or aluminum. Cast iron is fine, never nonstick. You will need a whisk. You will need 2 to 3 ounces of butter halved, separated into two halves. You will need some fresh thyme. Properly one Spriggs fine. You will need some cream and salt and black peppercorn, preferably fresh, to grind. So what you're going to do is you're going to put your eggs and the cream. The salt probably about 1/4 to 1/2 a teaspoon along with about 1/4 of sprig of thyme. Pereg up to the full spring depending on your taste, as well as black pepper to taste. Freshly ground into a bowl and whisk that until it is nice and smooth. You don't want any separation between the whites and yokes. Once that's done, you're going to take half of that butter, put it in the pan, toss that on the stove, and set it to about medium whatever is 300 to 350 degrees Fahrenheit on your stove. Once you start to get that rich, buttery aroma, but not to the point where it's starting to smoke, you're going to add half of that egg mixture and you're going to fold from the bottom, sort of forming a log on the side of the pan. And you're going to keep doing that until there's no more liquid left in the pan. At that time, you're going to add the rest of the butter and repeat until you've got one large log of egg with nice folds all the way through. And what you're going to do with that is then. Role that slightly until it's just a little bit crisp on the edges, but still wet. Complete and enjoy, and that is the proper way to have a French omelet.",7.0

I actually applied to a different job 'cause I wanted to get my foot into the door mainly because you know any being a new company really excites me that um they're always innovating, always changing it kind of it's it's a start up in a way. So that really attracted me to this company specifically. But you know, I got my foot in the door interviewing for another position. And then actually the leadership at the company said no, no, you would be a better fit for the cost management analyst position, which is a little more analytical and deals with more data, bigger data sets, which kind of fits my skill sets. It really what I want to do. So yeah, no, I I interviewed, got the job and it's really been cool. You know, the team that I'm on is a relatively new team. So it's, it's kind of a startup as well, not just with the company, but the company being new as well. The department is also new. So yeah, it's been really nice to kind of build kind of the framework of what this department is done and been able to be a part of some major sweeping changes of how we report, how we analytically look into the data, what tools we use and also you know, kind of how we go about reaching out to the different teams. And working with them on how to you know mitigate some of the costs that we're seeing as a company and also you know provide have them have better visibility on some of those costs and and what's going on with their daily operational activities.",4.0
"So my favorite food is actually a Turkey bowl. So kind of like a a bowl that you would get at Chipotle or Kava or one of those restaurants that that makes bowls or burritos. But I like to make my own ground Turkey bowl and I do this because ground Turkey is healthier than ground beef and also I find it to be very tasty when using the right seasonings flavors such as that. So I begin making the rice, so boiling some water and then once. The water's world, I obviously put the rice in and then mix the rice around until it mixes with the water and then let it steam for about 10 minutes, 1015 minutes, and wait for that to cook. That serves kind of as the base layer of the bowl, or kind of the bed of the bowl. Then you start with a pound of ground Turkey and you mix it up with a spatula or grounded up with a spatula to kind of break it into apart and get it into the really small pieces of the ground meat that you want. Um. And then after you do that, you cook it, add some paprika and a little bit of roasted herb and garlic seasoning or whatever seasoning you you prefer. Those are kind of my favorites. You sprinkle it on there and then let it steam and cook, let it cook totes nice and brown, and then you add a cheese. It could be either a cheddar cheese or or whatever kind of cheese you want. Then add whatever, whether it be spinach, you can add some spinach, add some greens in there, and then add. Whatever toppings, such as tomatoes, green onions or good ones, and then whatever sauce you want. So usually could you do salsa? I prefer taziki because I like the freshness of it. Then you could top it off with some cucumbers or whatever you want to add and finish up the ball and there you have it. That's your ground Turkey bowl.",5.0
"Hopefully this works this time. So yes, I am a cost management analyst. So a lot about what I do has to do is it's mainly a reporting function of the company. So I'm kind of nestled under the marine and planning a division, but I don't just analyze costs related to those functions. Anything that has to do with our North American operations such as rail trucking costs or anything going on at the terminal facilities. Any operational related activities in their costs might my main function is to provide visibility those costs work with the teams that kind of owned those costs and work on how to mitigate some of those costs moving forward by further creating tools to provide easier and better visibility and more efficient reporting of some of our operational costs that come with our daily activities.",5.0
"Are you looking for a fun and cost effective vacation? Cosmo Mexico is the way to go. Um, it's my favorite vacation spot because if it's not wildly expensive, it's very reasonably priced. That's 1/2. It is not extremely crowded. If you're looking for a nice tucked away island, kind of away from the the energy in the in the hype of Cancun, it is a nice kind of ferry ride off of the mainland of Mexico. So it's its own island and it is tucked in between over half. The island is a nature preserve, so it is very low key island. The people are very friendly, the drinks are very good, which is very important and most of all it is again like I said, very cost effective and can save you a book and the snorkeling and the wildlife is to die for. So Cosmo Mexico should definitely check it out.",
"Yeah. So I think in regards to my work life balance, I think the company actually does a fantastic job with the work life balance. I think I really enjoy the kind of ESG volunteer activities that we do. The efforts to, to really, you know go to happy hours after work and really build kind that camaraderie between between leadership and the employees. I really think that's a great thing that is being done. I think what could be improved. Is just the overall understanding of the function of the team that I'm on, right. So my team is a collaborative team. I'm analyzing and costs for all the operational teams and trying to work with them to improve it. Sometimes the team see us as kind of an audit tool and instead of like a tool to help them. So I think it could be better from the top down and described what the our team is really there for in the in an overall sense.",6.0
"Many experts talk about getting 10,000 steps per day as a good baseline as something you should shoot for to continue to, whether that be lose weight or keep in good shape now. Most, a lot of people get around 7500 steps. Now what does that look like in practice? I like to think about it as being on a track. So think about an entire mile as 10,000 steps. So what that what the 7500 steps would look like. But that would be 3 laps out of the four. So that would be doing one up around and then UH-2 laps around and then one more lap around to a total of 3 laps and that would be 7500 steps that you had just done out of the 10,000. Or one mile. So what that means is you were very close, you're almost, you're very close to the end and you have almost reached that 10,000 number or that last mile.",5.0

I was looking for analyst jobs and because of my background in statistics, I really wanted something that was data heavy or where I could easily analyze problems and help the company grow and get better at what they do.

"I am going to teach you how to make Alfredo fettuccine. Um. What you need is a. Pot. Olive oil, salt. Fettuccine noodles. And a stove top. So all you need to do is pour water about 2/3 the way into your pot. Also, depending on how big your pot is, you don't want to put too much water because it will take too long to boil. So once the water is added, you're going to turn your stove on to high, wait for it to bubble and boil, then you're gonna add your fettuccine noodles to the pot, and once that's added, I like to add some salt and olive oil just to make sure none of the noodles stick to each other. Then you're going to turn down the temperature to about medium high and cook for about 8-9 minutes. Once that time is past, you need to check your pasta to make sure it's not. Too hard still, and make sure it's Eldon TE. Then you're going to turn off the stove, move your pot, drain the pasta. And then you can either. Heat up the Alfredo sauce on your stovetop in a smaller pan or pot. Or you can do it the easy way and put some in a bowl in a microwave. Microwave safe bowl in heated up for a couple seconds at a time to make sure it doesn't burn. Or make a mess in your microwave. And then you can pour the pasta back into the pot you used. Pour the Alfredo sauce in it and stir it up and then you are ready to serve. If you want to take an extra step, you can also prepare some chicken to make chicken Alfredo. Uh. Otherwise you can either eat your pasta plain or with the Alfredo sauce and you will have a nice dinner.",7.0
"For vacation, I think you should go to Bermuda because of many reasons. You can go on a cruise to go to Marina and have so much fun on their drinking. Going to parties, not really parties, but um, just the activities that accrues offers. And once you get to the cruise Bermuda, there are plenty of things to do. You can take a bus ride, you can take a catamaran ride, you can go and visit all the shops. It is a very pretty island. I was just there. And everyone there is really nice and willing to help you get to where you need to be. Um, so there's also lots of other excursions you could do and other parts of the island you can visit, like Saint Thomas or Hamilton. But I think to fully enjoy it you should take a catamaran ride in Bermuda because it is really fun. You can go swimming in the ocean and you can look at all the pinks and and maybe take some home for yourself. So I recommend going to Bermuda because it's very pretty and there are lots of things to do there.",
"I really enjoy my workplace. I love the people I work with. It is they are really nice to be around in. Everyone is very helpful. We have a more of an open floor layout in the office so we can see each other. We can just stand up and say hey I have a question for you. The really main concern I have is that it is way too cold in the office and if it wasn't that cold I probably would not be as crabby. Sometimes. I have a blanket I used when it gets really cold and now that. We're in the winter season. I really hope that they change the temperature because otherwise it's very uncomfortable to be in the office sometimes. But I do enjoy being there. It's a lot easier to work there then at home sometimes and. Like I said before, I love the people I work with. They are very accommodating, especially my management.

"So. On average, a person produces about four pounds of garbage. I like to visualize this as perhaps a small puppy. That is how much garbage a person is producing each day. So little small dog. Um. And if you think about it, that's not a whole lot eh? Guesses. Depending on the person and what they do on a daily basis. It could be trash from food or just cleaning up around the house weekly. But on a daily basis you how you create a little small dog worth of garbage. And. Hopefully over time it does not grow into a bigger dog, otherwise it is more than £4.00 of trash. So I guess if you wanna keep it minimal you want to think of a puppy and that is how much trash you have and make sure you dispose of it properly. And think of it, I think of it as a puppy, so you could take care of it and make sure it is recyclable as needed and so forth.",6.0

"One of the earliest games I remember learning how to play with tic Tac toe. It's a very well known game, but if you're unfamiliar with it and I'll walk you with the steps of how to play it now. The game is very simple and can be learned very easily and we played by anyone of all ages. All you need is opponent and a surface for drawing a piece of paper and pen or pencil work best. First, you'll need to draw the board consists of three rows of three squares. Draw 2 horizontal lines and two vertical lines evenly spaced apart to create a three by three grid of squares. Each player will alternate turns by drawing symbols on the board. One player we use an X symbol and the other player will use uh oh symbol. The goal of the game is to be the first player to draw three other symbols. In a row on the board. The role of three symbols can be achieved either vertically, horizontally or in a diagonal manner. The game could not begin in the first player will start. Generally the first player uses X to mark symbol on the board, but. It can be alternated. Next player within marked their symbol in any of their mating squares. On the board that are empty. The players will keep alternating moves until one player has won the game by getting three symbols in a row. If all the squares are filled and no players have three symbols in a row, then the result of the game is that I. That's all there is to it. There's some more strategy. The gameplay once you start playing more and learn, but that's the basics you need to know to get started. Go on and try to play a game or two with a friend. Talk too fast.",6.0

"Oh yeah, so 2 minutes on how I got here. Uh, well, when I started working when I was 11 years old, I was a paperboy, and I had to wake up at 4:00 in the morning, distributed about 120 newspapers. And then once a month I had to go collect cash, mostly some checks and some other things. So that's when I started collecting money. Some people got behind because they were out of town or whatever, and I had to figure out ways to get ahold of them when they hadn't paid. It was 10 bucks a month each. So I got a cut about $200.00 a month of the whole shebang, so. Pretty good money for an 11 year old, but horrible money given the amount of work. Um, then I so that's when I started collecting um. Then I went to college, got my degree in geographic Information systems, segued that into. Current government doing real estate tax collection. A lot more money than that, you know, maybe 809 hundred bucks a month. I was able to squeeze out of people as a paperboy. Billions of dollars there. You know, God got my feet wet in the meta game, I guess. Then I moved to Richmond, got into court debt collection, which was very arduous, difficult, and generally unpleasant to collect from hardened felons. Um, they, you know, are hardened felons. Uh then after breaking from the government, I got into logistics. So I got into trucking, and I ran some billing and auditing platforms over in a large privately held trucking concern, did that through the pandemic, manage the building through a couple countries, shutting down.

"Alright um, so I'm going to go over how to cook a wood fired pizza. Um, assuming you've prepared the dough in the sauce and have your ingredients together, that's a whole other lesson I would take much longer than two minutes. But you're going to want to do is load 3 or 4 logs into the pizza and then let them heat up to about 600 degrees Celsius. Not Fahrenheit. Not hot enough um. And after the wood has basically. Gotten all of its smoke out in the oven, setting fairly consistent temperature. You're going to take your dough, and the trick is to stretch it in a way that is natural. Let the ingredients naturally pull apart. A lot of people, because they're afraid of bubbles, will smack the dough. Or use a rolling pin, or trying to push it out. But what you're really doing there is pushing more bubbles deeper into the dough, so you're going to want to naturally let it pull apart. Hold it up like this and let it stretch. Then, uh, you know you add sauce. Not too much here. She's just going to use like about a two or two tablespoons per pie. You want to get about that. And don't worry about perfection. It's pizza. Um, the rustic Ness is half the half the point. Then you know the mozzarella you're going to want to get. Not the highest moisture content, because that will leak out onto the dough and make your pizza soggy. So either drain it well or use a high moisture, low moisture content mozzarella. You know, put it on the peel. Uh, you can actually do all the saucing, everything on appeal, provided you get a good base of cornmeal and flour on the pizza, should be able to slide around freely in one fluid motion. You will set that into the oven and make sure it doesn't smear. It should. Just like a magician pulling a cloth from under a table to leave the dishes on it it. Then you have one minute. In then you can rotate it with your speed peel when you take it out. You're going to want to um. Kiss it to the top, the hottest part of the oven. That way you get a good carmelization of whatever ingredients are on top. Slide it out, cut it up, and you're good to go.",2.0

"Uhhh, elevator pitch on my favorite vacation destination would be Villa Cigar and San Martino bono Barga Italy um.

All the points that are developed in Italy, um, it's got a pool and some library, and it's built on ancient Roman ruins. So even if you just stick around the villa for a day or two, you'll probably get an engrossing experience. The caretaker is a nice guy and his wife makes amazing food.

It's actually worked pretty well. Um, But there's always room for improvement. Um. The thing that I would say that is a negative is that as a merger of three old guard container lines, there is a little more harder edge to a lot of the management styles. So there's a certain reflexive toxicity that you may encounter where your ideas are really put through a Crucible skepticism before they're allowed to get through it can be a good thing so that we're not just firing blind in all directions, but when you're trying to.

"An average person takes 7500 steps a day. Which is average is always misleading because this is the average between an ultramarathoner and someone who didn't get out of bed. It could be 20 miles because the other guy ran 40. So average is a little misleading, but median probably about 4000 steps. So if we were to look at the highest, lowest one in the very middle, 4000. So that's probably a better number. It's also a little low. You can improve the amount of steps you take by walking more. Is there a store up the street from you? Why don't you walk to it? And I know that walking back logging family of four hours worth of groceries is probably not not that much of a treat. But if you're going there multiple times a week for one bag of groceries, vegetables, something to that effect, it might be worthwhile.

"2 lines that stretch out over Infinity and never intersect are called parallel lines. A line that crosses 2 lines is called a transversal. Two parallel lines intersected by a transversal will form 4 pairs of corresponding angles. Corresponding angles that have the same position with regards to a parallel lines and the transversal. If the two lines are parallel, then the corresponding angles are congruent. This means that the angles measured the same. The four angles that are in between the parallel lines are called interior angles, and the four angles that are on the outside of the parallel line are called exterior angles. Angles that share a vertex on the same line are called adjacent angles. The sum of two adjacent angles is always 180 degrees. Two angles that are opposite from each other on intersecting lines are called vertical angles. Vertical angles are always congruent. Meaning they have the same measurement. With this information, as long as you have the measurement of 1 angle, you can always find the measurement of all 8 angles. When two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, there are only two angle measurements in this case the measure of angle X and 180 degrees minus the measure of angle X. Then all corresponding angles and vertical angles will have those. Same measurements.",7.0

Anytime you need something or help with something, there's always somebody willing to do that. One thing that needs to be improved. I feel is the work life balance. I think that we should be able to work from home more if we are able to. In the past two years over the pandemic, we've proven that were more than capable of working from home. So there's not really a huge necessity to be in the office. So if we could cut out the commute, that's more time that we can spend with our families.",5.0

"Hi, my name is Alexandra Trong and I received my undergraduate bachelors degree at Virginia Commonwealth University studying in Information systems. Now I want to talk about what drew me to this field. Business intelligence in addition to data management or data analytics. It started with my data mining and business intelligence course in my undergrad. Or I had a professor that I really liked. He always talked about when it comes to business, how do you make money? And when it comes to the lessons that we learned in our class with regards to Excel analytics, formulas, logic, one thing that we always kept in mind was what insights can regenerate and how can we make money for the business? Now we had the opportunity to sign up for a data competition where it was the extra credit opportunity for the students. I definitely volunteered and organized team of students to compete at the Library of Virginia. It was a two day competition where. We had to come together and figure out how could we resolve or come up with a solution for the Virginia opioid crisis. Well, we ended up doing was we looked at many disparate data sources and data sets to see what insights can regenerate. And after 2 long days of competing, we didn't win, but we did come up with a solution. It was then that I realized that there was a lot of value with regards to Wednesday to I saw so many insights and it was then that I realized that this was a field that I wanted to pursue. I wanted to pursue a career and data to see what insights can I find, what value can I deliver and how can I make money for the business.",7.0
"Hi in this day and age. We have so much information and data all around us. A lot of professionals and scientists believe that we currently live in an information economy. Where computing software. And many technological practices have advanced to the point where it has become exceedingly cheap to store data in large amounts. I believe we currently live in the day of big data. Now today I want to talk about data as an organizational asset. What is a data asset? A data asset is any piece of information that can be stored digitally. A data asset can be shared, reused, and stored in a digital format. An example of a digital asset can be any report. It could be any Excel spreadsheet that one has to leverage with regards to one business, or it could be a database. One key component though when it comes to a data asset is that it has reuse and with that there is value. One means of organizing data assets within once enterprise is by leveraging data inventory. With the data inventory, one can store all of their data assets all in one location and store and label metrics assigned to it. For example, name the user the owner to see who has leveraged or used the data asset. One of the benefits of leveraging the data inventory is allowing the business to make faster decisions. It allows for greater transparency where one can see where all the data assets are within one business and it will allow others to reuse them for the benefit of their business.",7.0

"I want to talk to you today about warming up before you get ready to workout or weight train. Some people don't work out, they don't stretch out. They don't hydrate and they're constantly struggling from pulled muscles, sore joints. In some of this could be avoided by simply a proper warm up. And what is the proper warmup include? Well, first, I think before you go to the gym and workout, you need to hydrate properly. So make sure you get you a nice big glass of water, a couple glasses of water, and make sure you're hydrated before you even start. Make sure you have plenty of rest. Before you go workout and upon entering the gym, after you've had plenty of rest and plenty of water. I would recommend that you get on a treadmill. Or some type of cardio device where you're getting your joints warmed up, getting you're getting in right mind space is important to that, gives you a chance to put on your favorite music, take some deep breaths, do whatever you have to do to get yourself mentally ready and then perform that five to 10 minute cardiac and then after that. Make sure you get a good stretch and what I mean by a good stretch, stretching your whole body, not just the body part you plan on training, but stretching out your whole body. Make sure it's ready for the impact that's about ready to happen. And after you stretch out, I also believe in warming up with the exercises that you choose. So doing one or two warm up exercises or sets just to prepare your body for about what's to incur. So always make sure. That you. Warm up correctly, do warm up sets, and then you're ready for that impact of that next exercise you're going to choose. So warm up properly and stay safe.",5.0

How many calories are you burning? Some people think that just because they consume like fruits, vegetables, healthy things, you should be eating healthy. But a calorie is a calorie is a calorie. So in order to lose weight, it's not only what you eat, but how many calories that you consume.

"Hey everyone. Today we're going to talk about my favorite food and how to make it. So today will be preparing chicken Curry, Indian chicken Curry um, the ingredients needed is first um, we need some of the meat. Spices are cumin, virtually powder, coriander, tomatoes, onions, ginger, garlic and of course the main ingredient chicken. So first in the pressure cooker, that's how I like to. Wet ***** but in a pressure cooker. Had a little bit of oil and add garlic to it and you keep stirring it until it starts to look like it's on a high heat. Then you add onions to it, and then you keep starting onions for a good five to 10 minutes um, until it turns color less. That's when you're ready to add the rest of your spices. So then I'll add you Add all of your main um, they're called a hot spices, but that's your basal leaves. Khuman, coriander powder, turmeric, red chili powder. And then you start mixing it when it looks like everything is kind of blended a little bit and that's when you add the chicken to it. Now the chicken is going to be in there for a little while. We keep stirring, keep mixing it till it looks like the chicken started blending soft and a little bit. That's when you cut up one tomato and you add to it and then you add water, um, water will kind of determine how much Curry you want. So I would probably say if you're doing like um. Four pieces of chicken drumsticks. They need to have a cup of water. That should be suffice. Then you keep stirring it when it looks like it's kind of mixing in well. You close the lid and you let the let it sit and let the whistleblower. After two whistles, you let it sit there and let it cool down a little bit. Once the bus um. It looks like it started fizzing down a little bit and that's when it's ready. You populate and that's your Indian chicken Curry. Homemade, very different from restaurant, but hope you enjoy it.

We'd love to be able to help you with that. We've got some unique capabilities both on the technology and also with the service team that works around this.

"Booking corporate travel at BNY Mellon, quite frankly not fun. First of all, we're using personal credit cards. Second of all, there's no unified online booking tool. So we go out to the open market. Our managers have to get involved. There's an approval process. The expense process is not fun either. So why not invoke some behavioral change and also boost morale and save money in the process of doing so? The tool that I'm referring to will calculate a budget to beat for every upcoming trip that an employee has and anything that they do to come in under that budget. That could be staying with a friend when they're on the road. That could be flying a cheaper airline. That could be flying a red eye. That could be, um, not renting a car and instead doing Uber with a friend or someone that you're traveling with. This is a game changer. We will save 10 to 15% year over year on our corporate travel spin and the employees will love it. This will be the IT trend across BNY Mellon for 23 if we do this.",7.0
"Now that the pandemic is winding down, knock on wood and corporate travel is going to reach unprecedented levels quickly. I would personally recommend a behavioral change tool to incentivize employees to use cost cutting actions when booking travel. What do I mean by an incentive? I'm talking about a reward point. The way that the software works is it calculates a budget to beat or a price to beat. Based on a criteria of an upcoming trip and if the employee can come in under that budget, half of the savings is realized by BNY Mellon as unspent money. The other half of the savings goes right into the pocket of the employee. There's a lot of science and math to the technology and the algorithm for calculation of that budget to beat, but ultimately your employees will think of this as a really fun reward. Kharo will think of this is a really fun reward, and most importantly, we will save money. Immediately.",7.0
"Back in my early 30s, I worked at a behavioral change company in the travel industry, corporate travel, and the way it worked was it is incentivized employees to use cost cutting actions when traveling in the form of a physical reward. So basically half of the savings went back to the company as unspent monies and half of the savings went back to the employee in the form of rewards points that you could buy gift cards with it. So it's really a very scientific and mathematical tool. To drive behavioral change, and this is exactly the same thing, we are talking about cost reduction. We are talking about improvement of morale. We're talking about empowerment of business users to make informed decisions. Ultimately, this is going to benefit the front office. There's going to be cost savings upfront. There's going to be revenue generation towards the end of the cycle and in the middle, your employees will. Thank you.",7.0

Well, a data asset is anything or entity that can be stored, reused, and shared within the enterprise. Examples include an Excel report, an Excel spreadsheet, uh, PowerPoint, a website, or even a document. As long as you can share it with someone digitally, it doesn't have to be physically, it's considered to be a data asset. Now, data assets hold a lot of enterprise organizational value. Whether it means providing an insight, saving time, helping someone else do their work, it's critical that we save it in something called a data inventory. Data inventories hold a lot of value within an enterprise. Within a firm. It's where you would store all your data assets into one centralized location for other people to reuse and find.

It could take containers, different shipping pieces of information and data so that we can derive insights and value and answer some complex reporting questions, such as how long did it take for this shipping container or all shipping containers to ship out of France to North America. Using key elements from SQL such as groupby, orderby, select. Partitioning windows to all these complex SQL tools, so to speak, allow us to mix and match data and information so that we can source it in a unique way and derive insights for the business.

Elementary school to middle school to high school teaching abilities with a background in education, with a college degree in education, leaving their jobs, working back in the public sector or the private sector. What a shame. Statistics show that math scores and reading scores have dropped across the board with students across America. How we compete on an international level, we are simply behind when it comes to test scores like math, science. In the areas of STEM, it is so difficult just to hold everything together with regards to public education. Why? It's because it's controlled at a federal and state level, it's difficult to assess. The right amount of funding because public education is funded by the taxpayers dollars. Public education varies across the board because. Depending on where you live, tax dollars will always vary depending on the amount of property taxes that people pay in the incomes that that people have within that area.

We then use SQL to restructure that data using syntax like select, groupby, orderby when doing functions, temporary tables, all of these methods to transform structured information into key insights, and that's.

That's why I love working at Ocean Network Express, or bear one. It is the 6th largest shipping container company across the globe. Lately, in 2018 to 2017, one was created as a joint venture, merging from NY K00M 0SK. And. K line. These three shipping companies are one of the largest in the world, and it's allowed us to ship multiple commodities across the ocean from East Asia to North America. 1.",

Students are coming out of college with. A lot. A lot of that because college prices have skyrocketed like crazy. Finding a job is not that easy, especially not with specially finding a well paying job, and apart from all of this, with COVID and with everything that has happened, inflation. It's almost impossible to find a house in this job in this market in this year. And why is that so? Everything. Houses are just super expensive today. You are seeing record high prices where for example my parents house was bought in 2011 for about 90,000. Today it can go to about it. It's valued at about 300,000. That's almost triple what they paid for. And that is a huge problem because people coming out of college are not making enough money to keep up with this inflation.

What is the process model? Basically what it sounds like it is a chart with all of the different tasks and what processes are to be taken in order to create. In order to accomplish. The job tasks that you are trying to do. So how do you do this? Simple, there are different tools. At Ocean Network Express we use something called signavio. In Signavio you put in the different swimlanes, water, swim legs, swim lanes is where you put what teams do what tasks. So for example, let's say we have the the. Equipment team who starts to dispatch. Containers. So in the first one land, what are we going to have equipment team. And then what will be in there? We're going to have all of the different tasks that they do in rectangles, so contact the. The trucker task one and then etc. Tax BCD, well, what happens after that?

"Ocean Network Express is a global freight carrier. We deliver by ocean, by rail and by truck. We have the relationships, the experience and the know how to master each leg of transportation journey, not just to get your freight to the port like many other competitors. If you consider the fragmented nature of shipping leading up to this decade, we have emerged as one of the leaders of consolidation, combining 3 rich histories of three very different Japanese shipping companies with roots dating back over 100 years each. We've combined that to the best possible leveraging of customer service, capacity and care. It's true. We are small enough to care, but large enough to serve on a global scale and to compete. A recent acquisition of the Seaspan Corporation illustrates this. As such, we're taking the profits that we've learned in the pandemic, and we're reinvesting them a new capacity to serve you better. Ocean Network Express is truly the global shipping partner that you need. To consolidate your supply chain and deliver on promises to your customer. We firmly believe in our mantra as one we can.",
"In 500 BC. 40% of the land in Sparta was owned by women. Why does this matter? Because property ownership has gone in the wrong direction in today's society. We should have at least 40% of the land owned by women, probably more like 50, maybe even higher than that. There. Half the population. After all, why is it fair that men should hold so much land? Today, 40% was a high number because today in our society, I don't know exactly what the number is, but I'm sure it's less than 40% of land that women own. That's unjust. It's not right, it's not fair, and it makes it difficult to build generational wealth for single mothers. We should create tax incentives.

"Story that illustrates the importance of education. Is the age-old parable. Give a man a fish. And he'll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish. Forever. What does this really mean to modern education? It's a combination of experiential hands on learning. And giving students the little push that they need to go beyond just copying notes off the board or soaking up lectures from professors. And really taking that next step to get their hands dirty. To go on field trips. To do further research on their own. And really understand the material on a personal level that suited to their learning style, which is different for everyone I might add. I truly believe that there's a reason why this phrase is still around, and if more education administrators, more professors, and more students were to take this into account and think of it as more than a trite cliche. But, uh, manner of holistic education. We'd all be a lot wiser as a result. So when we think about teaching someone to fish. Rather than giving them that fish, we should consider its impact across the chain of the educational ecosystem. Administratively. Professor Lee. And definitely on the level of a student.

"Today I'm going to teach you how to hunt for shipping containers. That was the hobby that got me into this job in the first place. Basically, you can sneak into train yards and different kind of container depots if you're able to look at where there's no fences and when the businesses are not operating. But if you've worked for container line like we do, then you can just pretty much send an e-mail and ask them. When can I come and visit? And once you're there, you should make sure that you have either a good cell phone camera or preferably a DSLR. With the zoom lines to save yourself some walking. What this will do is it will enable you to capture containers that are high in the air. Ones that are a little bit far away. And everything in between. You can get a lot in one shot, or you can hone in on just one. With big zoom lenses, sometimes you have to be careful of barrel distortion, which is where rectangular objects like a shipping container may appear. Not quite at a right angle, they may appear to have a dipping line on top or bottom, but I find that not shooting straight on can help to decompensate for this. And shooting the nose or the tale of the container and zooming in on a diagonal angle can effectively eliminate barrel distortion. You want to look for something old new. Or interesting. Refrigerated containers open top containers, even flat racks. They're very unusual, but they're out there if you know where to look. Trying to keep track of the different prefixes. Operators and types can be hard, but. You get as much out of it as you put in and sometimes you get lucky. I find it to be a rewarding hobby. I'm going on over 15 years and I will continue to hunt containers.",7.0
"We're going to talk today. We're going to talk about how to mitigate per diem charges in the ocean shipping industry. What are per diem charges? How do they arise? Why would we need to mitigate them? Well, the way the rules set up, containers that have been pulled from their final inland destination be at Portora rail. Have a limited amount of free time that they can be unloaded and returned. To the depot empty. Any aberration of the free time will result in the installation of a daily charge referred to as per diem. Per diem generally can be around $140 a day. That adds up quick. Right now, the current rules that per diem charges are passed on to the trucker. Now, how to trucker cause per diem? It's possible if they pulled the container out of the portal rail, placed it on the yard, and ran into mechanical issues with trucks or staffing issues with drivers scheduling problems on their end. That they created the problem. Certainly it's possible. However, in practice it's not really all that likely because the main source of per diem seems to be limited warehouse capacity to accept shipments. Due to staffing, capacity of physical items or anything else? This ties up our chassis, creates headaches of billing for our truckers who received the bills. And it also makes our containers themselves become scarce. We are doing everything we can to try to get evidence and reduce the amount of bills and arguments that we have about these bills with our partners, but. Basically, changing the rule over to go back to the customer first would mitigate most of these problems.",7.0
"Today we're going to discuss how to mitigate per diem charges which arise in international container shipping once containers have reached the inland destination. And they have surpassed the allotted amount of free days. Charges begin to pile up each day, usually $140 a day. A combination of accountability on the trucking side and transparency when warehouse appointments don't exist to take containers within free time could be instituted to provide higher visibility and mitigate such charges or allow for auto acceptance of invoices so that we could stop so much back and forth. Nobody really has time for the emails or the detective work. If we're going to institute such charges, we should have more transparency along the system.",

Does in hospital for awhile start again? I was in hospital for awhile and um. I needed to do something else. Um was made redundant from her job. And then I looked. Around in the industry to go back into the engineering roll on my license engineer and I decided to, um, take on this job with General Electric and to start off with that was a fairly steep move. It was applying for General Electric in Australia and this is my new after this, about six months after I had been recovered from a Hang Gliding accident. Anyway, and um originally applied for a job in Australia, then what happened is I didn't get the position in Australia.

Would you like to work in Frankfurt and come from any of you next weekend and it pretty well just happen like that. So the following work weekend I flew from Sydney, Australia to Frankfurt, Germany.

"Hi, my name is Doug Stevenson. I'm just going to take you through a bit of history of Qantas. Qantas actually stands for Queensland and Northern TL services and it was actually is Qantas is actually older speaking, the oldest airline in the English speaking world and it's 101 years old now and it was started by two First World War um aviators from the Royal Flying Core. They went to Gallipoli together. That's a famous. Battle that Australia unfortunately lost. And then they charged me Shiva, which is a famous victory that we did win. And um, these two aviators, they came back and after they were in the light horse and a charter life horse become the Royal Flying Core. In 1920 they joined up in Australia in Queensland, that's the top region of Australia, Australia. And they set up an airline and originally it was set up in a place called Tennant Creek and there was only just originally for mail. And then it just grew over the years as you can see these 747, this is a 747 aircraft. You can see it's an older generation aircraft because it's got the smaller upper deck on it. This is a 200 series where the later one had the higher windows and a stretch upper deck and that's where the and it was a longer aircraft and that's where I went into the next generation aircraft which is the three and 400 series the tail they took. See this here, this is a flying kangaroo. Very unique to Qantas and very unique to Australia. In 1988 they actually took the uh the the wings of the kangaroo. So now the IT is actually the flying kangaroo, but it hasn't got the wings on it anymore. And you can see now they've taken this also this orange livery off the side of the aircraft 'cause this is typical of the 1986 era, this this 747 and unfortunately it's got the Pratt and Whitney engines on it, not GE.",4.0

The limit is 5 cockpit units. However this was just unusual as the aircraft is taxiing in it reached this through copy unit level. So what I do is I look at one engine right and then I look at the other engine to see if the same phenomena happened both engines. And at the moment I am seeing a similar font phenomena, which means maybe it's a thrust reverser or maybe the aircraft hit a bump and both engines the vibration peaked at the same time.

Criminally aggressive when it comes to collections. I would say though that if you look at how far somebody would go for a very small amount of money, you could take that and apply it. In uh, in uh, in the sense where we're thinking structurally about the importance of what we're doing now, this isn't a street pride situation. This is professional business setting, but. The the seriousness with which they are approaching their activity is the professional, and I'm going to use that term very lightly, but the way that they are considering that the funds that I owed them as a personal thing that they have. Grasped the things that are owed to them. Maybe some things that aren't. And and internalised it to such an extent that they're willing to do whatever it takes. Uhhh. Structurally, that would probably be the only sound way to take any lessons from all of gangsta rap and apply them to accounts receivable majority 99.9% of that accounts receivable work.

But more importantly, it's a sign of canine obesity and I would feel, I think, that most people need to accept responsibility for their pets weights, less they be forced to face the everyday maintenance issue of hyperadrenocorticism. We all know how bad that can get. I've taken it pawn myself to measure my dogs meals and put away food dishes between meals. Also no more table scraps. No more. Treats in general. Sometimes streets.

Um. But I also need to make help make the products cheaper and quicker to build. Um. So in my previous role at GE I was working as an MPI engineer. And that's at that time I got uh a flavor and appreciation for cost out um. So in that role I work closely with manufacturing our customer and our engineering team to take take the product and products through concept stage through to qualification um. During that time I managed to immerse myself in a few smaller projects such as simplification, simplification of components. And build processes and also how to make the? Products quicker to build. Uh, so one of the people I worked for during that time, he actually moved on and became the cost that leader for a military program, which is the role that I now have. We actually kept in contact throughout the time he was in charge of cost out and when he decided to move on, he reached out to me as he thought it would be a good career move for me, um as he thought it would be perfect for it.

Yeah, you you dice up the the chicken.

Um, the onions I dice up, doesn't matter what size you have. And then um, you use a walk for this, so you fill it with water. I can't remember how much it says it does actually sound in the package. And then what you do is you add the chicken, you add the carrot, the potato union, so it looks a bit like a Stew. And you just let that boil for for a bit. You make sure that the potatoes and the carrots are all correct once they're cooked, then turn the heat off, and then you slowly add the Curry cubes, but you mix it in with the water very slowly.

I left high school after the sex year of high school where I was very academic and I had potential to go to university. However, I was very amateur so I would have lasted at university as long as my clean clothes that. So I decided that was based on me to go into the workplace. By that time I didn't really know what type of job I wanted, so thankfully my dad. As a roofer and I worked with him on roofs for 18 months, which was absolutely fantastic, a great experience. And then the three days that you get off summer in Scotland, that was brilliant, but there are 362, it was not good at all. So then I decided to do some research, found out about local companies that offer apprenticeships, to which I found GE. And then I've done some more research on what you need to get on apprenticeship at GE. So I then went to the local college for 12 months to do a course that will prepare me for GE. Went through our Regulus recruitment process so it went from CV submission, Aptitude Test, Group assessment and then final interview. So I really had and challenging process but thankfully I was selected at the end and then went through a three-year plan to ship and worked on the Gen X aircraft engine and after that I moved onto the shop floor full time working in high pressure turbine strip and bowed and then after that I was offered the opportunity to come back and work with that played this team.

Whilst the kettle is boiling you put the tea bag and just spoonfuls of sugar or sweetener and your T and their cup. Sorry.

Then once your minutes up you use a teaspoon to squeeze the teabag and get all the rest of the T water into the cup then usual. Teaspoon to skip the tea bag out. Put that in the band.

From about 10 thirty 11:00 AM you go to pubs and there is someone playing live music on a guitar which is, you know good for atmosphere, good to chill out with your friends and have a nice time.

The thing is, when you sum all of these up, it's it's suddenly ends up in a place like this. I really like my job because of the because of how we work.

And also when you're boiling it, try to do it in a low heat instead of high heat. Let's talk about the chicken first of all, chicken as basically flavorless like you can flavor it however you want. My goal to spices are generally black pepper, salt, some cumin, some Curry if I have it, the powdered ones, and a lot of hot spices. What you're going to do is basically, if you don't have a lot of time, just cut your chicken into uh into smaller pieces and then it's easier to cook. Uh, you can season them while you're cooking or before you cook. You can marinate them as well. Um, and when it comes to like. Basically making the food um um, you need some vegetables.

I think I have a million favorite foods, but I decided to go with one of the most recent favorite foods I'd made, which was chocolate birthday cake as my sisters birthday last week. She also absolutely loves her birthday cake, so of course I had to make her one. Um, she actually doesn't consume animal products. So I had to use a different recipe to your traditional bacon cake recipes. So I used a vegan recipe. So in vegan bacon you are usually substitute in the eggs for sort of buttermilk, which is created using soy milk and apple cider vinegar. They mixed together and create this sort of because substance sounds a little growth, but believe me you don't taste the vinegar and it does. And then you also substitute butter with oil. So then you just use your usual bacon ingredients, flour, sugar, cocoa powder 'cause this was a chocolate cake. So all of those game mixed together and poured into tins for sponges. They went into the oven and they cooked beautiful sponges. Then to make the ice into that great, I mixed vegan margarines. With icing, sugar and cocoa powder, again all mixed together. And then I pretty much slather this on the cake all around this, so it was very chocolaty. And then to top it off I created a chocolate drip, which is a sort of melted drink that goes down the sides of the cake. Did this by melting dark chocolate with vegan double cream so they melt together. You pop it on the cake, it goes down the sides and all drips down and it was fantastic with a cup of tea on the side.",5.0

"How many of you know what your cholesterol level is? I'm sure you don't, because one in three people have never checked it first of all. And that's number is even higher when you get older, which is when you need it the most. And women are a little bit better going to the doctor that men, but not much. We do know also that one in four women have not gotten any care because of the pandemic. And the effect of this people don't realize is the entire society is affected by the pandemic but also in the medical care down the line. So for example, if you are a woman who's pregnant, you have a baby and that baby is born pre term or you have high blood pressure in pregnancy. That baby and you are at higher risk of heart disease when you're at age 40 or your baby when your babies at age 40 or higher risk of heart disease. So everything we do now, even in utero, effects what happens to you later in life. In addition, some of those genetic things can change over time. So the moms pregnant, if you eat the wrong foods, if you have as I said, hi Phillip, pressure, hypertension, their epigenetic changes that happen in the baby that will not show really until their age 40. So the real way for people to take care of their health is right from the beginning.

No, it treated and keep track of it for the life of your health. This is particularly important when moms are pregnant. Because that baby in Nuro has many, many effects from being affected by those blood vessels. When you have high blood pressure. Your blood vessels constrict. Blood flow goes down to the placenta. And that affects the long term health of that baby. So what can we do? Of importance. Is going to the doctor. Now. Pregnant. Non pregnant. Go now. Check your blood pressure. Check your cholesterol.

"How many of you know that your birth weight? Can determine your health long term. How many of you realized that what happened to you already in euro before your birthday affects your long term health?

Who did not have enough nutrition and we're actually during this famine or followed for 40 years. They were fine to have higher rates of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. So what can be done? Well, more attention needs to be paid. Two pregnancy care and in general, health in neutral. We need to optimize Women's Health. Their Wellness and nutrition. In particular, we have to think about those who are less fortunate and those who are actually living in poverty now. If you imagine the world in which we haven't. 80% rate of childhood. Food insecurity. In some cities, that translates into a family affected by this famine. Which later translates into higher rates. Of cardiovascular disease in 30 or 40 years from now.

"Theo is the CFO of a 17,000 person company based out of Miami, FL. He's considering moving all of his assets onto BNY Mellon, and he has taken a thorough look at the competitive landscape. One of the things that seems to differentiate us is the senior leadership and his connection to that senior leadership. So when you consider some of the changes that they're trying to make from an operational perspective and from a risk mitigation perspective, our solutions will be unparalleled in this space. Everything will be deeply rooted in data management and those classic challenges around transparency and lineages and visibility of data. And auditability of data will all be at the forefront of the decision. Our platform is second to none and I would love an opportunity to meet with Theo, tell him a bit more about it, introduced the team and produce some client references for him 'cause we're really going to be able to save him a lot of money. We're really going to help him drive operational risk and hopefully will help him increase his revenue in his bottom line.",7.0
"So Kevin, we're investment data management really comes down to empowering business users to make informed decisions based on having clean quality audited data right at the center of 1's architecture. This seems to be one of theose fundamental challenges is trying to figure out how to do this all the while not having to on board and higher and spend additional money. So with costs in mind, we've developed a program. And a proof of concept that I think will be very, very interesting to the audience amongst his operational support group and also across his front office. We take a very methodical approach to data management, which includes ingestion and interrogation of data, data typing and normalization, data validation, unique identifier creation and mastering. And then really the rubber hits the road on data visualization and reporting. And how to get data from point A to point B, having that transparency at Theo's fingertips, being able to have that oversight, being able to have that confident in his confidence in his staff, all in a public cloud enabled machine learning and artificial intelligence enabled workflow enabled platform will be a true game changer to his organization. And ultimately when you look at some of his goals and his financial challenges, this is something that will be able to save him significant. Amount of money Dr operational efficiency by retiring legacy infrastructure and sunsetting legacy infrastructure and holds ultimately make the front office decision making process more easier and more transparent, thus driving revenue.

"Booking corporate travel at BNY Mellon, quite frankly not fun. First of all, we're using personal credit cards. Second of all, there's no unified online booking tool. So we go out to the open market. Our managers have to get involved. There's an approval process. The expense process is not fun either. So why not invoke some behavioral change and also boost morale and save money in the process of doing so? The tool that I'm referring to will calculate a budget to beat for every upcoming trip that an employee has and anything that they do to come in under that budget. That could be staying with a friend when they're on the road. That could be flying a cheaper airline. That could be flying a red eye. That could be, um, not renting a car and instead doing Uber with a friend or someone that you're traveling with. This is a game changer. We will save 10 to 15% year over year on our corporate travel spin and the employees will love it. This will be the IT trend across BNY Mellon for 23 if we do this.",7.0
"Now that the pandemic is winding down, knock on wood and corporate travel is going to reach unprecedented levels quickly. I would personally recommend a behavioral change tool to incentivize employees to use cost cutting actions when booking travel. What do I mean by an incentive? I'm talking about a reward point. The way that the software works is it calculates a budget to beat or a price to beat. Based on a criteria of an upcoming trip and if the employee can come in under that budget, half of the savings is realized by BNY Mellon as unspent money. The other half of the savings goes right into the pocket of the employee. There's a lot of science and math to the technology and the algorithm for calculation of that budget to beat, but ultimately your employees will think of this as a really fun reward. Kharo will think of this is a really fun reward, and most importantly, we will save money. Immediately.",7.0
"Back in my early 30s, I worked at a behavioral change company in the travel industry, corporate travel, and the way it worked was it is incentivized employees to use cost cutting actions when traveling in the form of a physical reward. So basically half of the savings went back to the company as unspent monies and half of the savings went back to the employee in the form of rewards points that you could buy gift cards with it. So it's really a very scientific and mathematical tool. To drive behavioral change, and this is exactly the same thing, we are talking about cost reduction. We are talking about improvement of morale. We're talking about empowerment of business users to make informed decisions. Ultimately, this is going to benefit the front office. There's going to be cost savings upfront. There's going to be revenue generation towards the end of the cycle and in the middle, your employees will. Thank you.",8.0
"Today I'm here to teach you about an Italian specialty known as pesto. Best though is the optimal dish to prepare at the end of the summer, early fall, because you need to harvest your basil plants. Basil being the optimal and traditional ingredient to make pesto, however. There are substitutions that can be made when you think of pesto. The basic elements of a pesto are eh green, in this case, basil, eh nut, normally pine nuts, olive oil and parmesan cheese. If you are do not like basil or you think the taste is too strong, another optimal crop to harvest at the end of the summer is arugula, which can be used in your pesto. As well as substitutions can be made in the nuts. Traditionally, pasta with pesto comes from Genoa, and the pine trees native to the area are what's used for Pino leaves or pine nuts. Substitutions can be made and traditional substitutions all throughout Italy, including walnuts and pistachios. In order to prepare the pesto, what you need to do is blend your greenery basil, traditionally your nut pine nut, with garlic oil and parmesan cheese. The important part of pasta, which is often excluded, is making sure that the pasta water is preserved to make the sauce creamy. Once you boil your pasta, please make sure that you take a certain amount of the pasta water, about 1/2 a cup to a full cup, depending on how thirsty your pasta is. What you can do is put that pesto and pasta in a bowl with the sauce and vigorously stir it to make the pesto creaming. In conclusion, try experimenting with different forms of greenery and nuts for the optimal past. Um.",6.0

"Great. Thanks to you. Thanks for giving me the background that I really understand much more clearly the challenges that you're looking at. There are definitely some benefits to making a transition in a move. One of the key things is it sounds like you're struggling with failed trades and not being able to get anybody on the phone when it comes to clearing and settling trades through your custody accounts. We'd love to be able to help you with that. We've got some unique capabilities both on the technology and also with the service team that works around this. The key thing that we do through our prime custody platform is we've really built a White Glove service that's geared Tord exactly the key things that you said. Now one of the key hurdles that you spelled out was transitioning and the effort that goes into that. We've spent a lot of time focusing on how to make a really good smooth glide path and transition. And that includes streamlining the KYC process, the setup and all the other work that we do around making sure that we can deliver for our clients. We want to make sure that we've got the right client service team built around this. And the good news is we've got plenty of clients down in Miami.

If you'd like, I'd love to spend some time with you and show you a demonstration of the the platform and the capabilities 'cause there's some things that we've automated on the data front and on the reporting front that will probably address some of those key critical items that you mentioned.

We want people to focus on a passion for excellence and integrity. And their core principles to the way that we build and grow our business.

So like I said, the morale boosting of actually automating and doing a whole host of things that would take some of this challenge out of their daily, daily day today is something that we think we can really help with. The core next step here is to get the team together, show them the platform, introduced them to the team, and we can walk through exactly how we can get the data and the information that they need. Into their hands. So they're not the ones running around chasing it with that in mind and with that as a key target, we can certainly help deliver on exactly what your business needs.

The prep is so overwhelming you must, must, must include others in the work. Everybody always wants to do it by themselves. That never works. Even if you prep all week. Trying to create the perfect Thanksgiving meal by your lonesome is very lonesome, but also is very draining. And by the time it's meant to be enjoyed, you're too tired to engage in meaningful conversation with your family and friends. So make sure that you are including everybody along on the preparation journey. Get your husband, get your kids. Get your relatives and your friends and your mom and your. Neighbor to help you out in the preparation of all of those delicious ingredients. What's on the table? Obviously the Turkey, except for vegetarians. Last year we ended up making two ingredients, the Turkey and a tofurkey. Then, moving onto the starchy sides, I'd like to do a combination of two things. My mother-in-law always brings a sweet potato casserole with mushrooms outside with marshmallows and brown sugar topping, and I like to do roasted Rosemary potato wedges plus and Israeli couscous topped with caramelized onions. And then onto the fresh vegetables, there was a combination of those as well. There is the fresh raw ingredients that you traditionally served, like a salad or crudites. And then there's the roasted.

Are you going to spend time with your family and friends? Now open your eyes. You've just imagined 2 to 4 extra hours that you get to leverage each week, because you are not, I repeat, are not physically going into the store to complete your shopping. Now, what does that mean for us as a manufacturer? We have to be creative. We have to be collaborative. We have to use our imagination to convince our shoppers to buy our products online, have them delivered to their home in a non invasive way by prompting them to make us as their preferred choice. We will no longer have end caps to build our displays on or floor displays or entry displays. We're going to have to be very creative and how he captured our consumers attention without being with them on location. Let's explore new digital assets and new techniques we could leverage. I'm going to bring it three that I think are important for us to focus on. One is the 8 plus content we need to have. People need beautiful imagery to pick from. 2. They need to be compelling.

Now that's the three hours that we gain by not going and doing our shopping online in store and instead doing our shopping online. My question to you is. How can we make that work? How can we make it work for our business when all of our established practices are to leverage in store communication with our shoppers?",
"I may not look like it. But I mean that may not sound like it. But let me tell you, I'm angry. And I'm sad and I'm frustrated. And nearly every day for the last six years, I've wanted to cry as my children go through the new education norms and learning how to read. How I feel does not necessarily show on the outside, but as a constant anxiety riddled rollercoaster that runs through my mind whenever I see any one of my three children attempting to tackle their schoolwork. Yes, I will admit I will be the first to admit that I'm not an education expert. But I will also be the first to admit that I am angry that our district has not changed their teaching norms and how they educate our children to learn to read. Learning to read is not unnaturally developed skill. Learning to speak and understanding spoken language is a naturally occurring progress in childhood growth. We grow up learning what the words are and how people speak to us and how to use those words. That's a naturally occurring event. Learning how to read is not, and yet our school system is attempting to treat it that way, and all three of my children have gravely been mistreated in trying to learn reading that way.

"My greatest take away from the last 10 weeks of working with you all is the foundational understanding that there is a big difference between being engaging when you're speaking in small groups. And being engaging with an audience and being engaging with the information that you're sharing to the audience. There is a very big difference between boring numbers that some people like and exciting pieces of information that people can visualize and then internalize based on how you present the information. Having a fun voice or fun face or fun hand gestures can be distracting. Having consistent information that you can present in a meaningful and clear way is very important to your audience, and doing so without a lot of this is also critically important.",7.0

In my opinion, comes close to exceeding us in the IT space we spend. 76% of our budget on IT infrastructure and how to improve it and make our customers. Satisfaction level. Um. Increase and that's where we find ourselves as. The differentiator in the custodial business. Um. I know we've talked about a lot today.

And if we can make your employees and your staff become more efficient and better at their jobs with the technology that you're able to get through BNY Mellon. I think it's a no brainer in the end.

"Hey, good morning. Good evening, everyone. I'm going to teach you on the topic today, quality assurance. How are you ensuring the product quality across the organization, what it means? What is important to ensure that our product is quality product. Look, quality is a differentiator. You all know, like you know if you want to stand into the market, we have to be a competitive then we should be on top of quality product delivering the quality product to a customer and that will be determined not by you, it will be determined by your customers if you are. Manufacturing some products and delivering to our customers and customers going to experience that product and if his experience is very good, he's using that product without any issues, comfort ubly and he's satisfied with that product that means whatever you build. That quality is good. And that's how we should measure the product quality, not from the hour angle, but it from the customer. You like how customer feels about it. Yes, of course. To do that there were different processes we need to follow and. Lot of activities has to be performed proactive. Activities and then I suggest to do that first start with the understanding your customer expectation. Until you know what is your customer expectation, you are not going to plan the further activities to produce that product and delivered to customers. So it's very important. To understand customer requirement in depth, document it and then plan your product plan, your processes considering those customer inputs, customer expectations and that's how that will build a good product quality and help your customer de lightness.

Is that we got to make sure as a company that we provide invoice transparency to our customers. So where were we prior to ASRA? Wow. Our invoice is only calculated things charges at like a level. For instance, you had. For $500.00 of the merge and we just got a $500.00 bill. That's all you got $500.00 to merge. Now it's broken down a little bit differently. And what do I mean by that? Well. For instance. The charges will be in your invoice, but now will be broken down a little bit different. There's going to be tiered rates. And what do I mean by tiered rates, right? Days one through 4 you were charged this, days 5 through 7 you were charged this. So now the customer can see the exact charges of what they incured, whether it be detention. Demerge. Customs. And various other charges. And now I think we will develop a better relationship with our customers while being. Compliant. With the FMC.

"Have you ever wondered why you got achy joints? Soreness, maybe new knees or elbows? Well. It's because maybe you're not stretching out correctly. So how do you do that? Well, there's a couple ways you can do that. Not just stretching, but warming up. And what do I mean by that simple 5 minute walk? 5 minute. Brisk walk on a treadmill before you get ready to hit the gym. Followed by 5 to 10 minutes of some stretching, and some people they do the old I just stretch out my lower leg, my legs. Maybe it's just my upper body. Um, but you need to stretch out your whole body. Even though if you're only training your legs, you don't need to stretch out everything and warm up everything. 'cause you don't realize the recruitment of your other body parts that assist in that, for instance if you're doing legs. Using your, you know, back, using your core muscles and if you got way down, you're doing squat's. You know, we got weight on your shoulders, so you need to stretch out all those muscles and then the most important thing. After you do their work out and you get stretched out. Prior to. You're going to do a cool down stretching you know after you workout 'cause you just put you just tag those muscles or constricted their tight. So now we gotta stretch him out. We've got to get that blood flow back in there. So that way we don't build up a lot of lactic acid, so we want to stretch out after. We get done. So there's a lot of good points right there. One warm up correctly. Brisk walk to stretch out. Before working out and after working out, those would be the keys of success to avoid those achy joints and muscle soreness.",6.0

"So I'm curious. On a scale from one being not very much to 10 being cold sweat level anxiety. How anxious are you about your ability to? Get pregnant and have a healthy baby. You can share it out. Thank you so much for sharing. There seems to be a range of answers. Do you want to know something interesting? I've asked this question of hundreds of individuals. At this point, can you guess what the average answer is? It's a 7. A7 Regardless of personal health history, regardless of family health history, meaning whether or not the individual has anything that could make them anxious about planning to conceive or trying to conceive, or if they have family around them that have struggled. So why is this happening? Well, probably a couple reasons, but one could be that we're seeing rising rates of infertility. Friends, family members, colleagues around us having trouble getting pregnant, having healthy pregnancies and having healthy babies. Maybe it's 'cause folks are getting pregnant later in life and there are more concerned about their ability to conceive. Lots of reasons. But you know what I call this? Reproductive anxiety.

"Did you know that sperm counts have dropped 60% in the last 40 years? That's a massive, massive drop. And it's happening globally. So why aren't more people talking about this? I cannot believe this is not headline news. Sperm counts dropping 60% in the last roughly half decade. This is massive. The bigger question is why? There are lots of theories out there. And the most compelling one is that our modern environment is mismatched with our genes. Our bodies were designed to conceive, but our modern environment was not. The way we are eating and moving and living. Has changed more in the last. 50 years than it has in the last 10,000 were eating more food like substances rather than food. We're moving less or more stressed than ever before. Our community is. Are further and further disconnected. This is not how our ancestors lived. And our ancestors were able to thrive and procreate. Much, much, much more seamlessly. As a result. So what the heck do we do about this? Well, we can take some inspiration from our ancestors and realign our biology with our environment. Teach our bodies that it's a safe and stable environment within which to conceive, which means getting nutrient dense food, moving regularly, being in nourishing relationships, and sleeping well. All of the basics. It doesn't have to be so complicated. And when we align our biology within our environment, I imagine we're going to start to see a rebalancing of hormones or rebalancing of our fertility and hopefully a healthier planet.",8.0

So if you think about that, that means that most women. Owned land, which is kind of a wild idea. Maybe not so wild. But in 500 BC? It's an interesting thing to think about.

Of advantages we can get by gaining promotions at work and all of that. This cannot be overemphasized, because being present with your child makes you observe things that you can change.

First of all you need to draw the board. It consists of three rows. Evenly spaced. You draw 2 horizontal lines. And two vertical lines spaced evenly apart create a three by three grid. Each player will alternate turns by drawing symbols on the board. One player will use an X and the other player using oh symbol. The goal of the game is to be first to draw three symbols in a row. On the board, the C3 symbols can be achieved either vertically, horizontally or in a diagonal manner. The game can now begin. The first player will start.

"OK, my favorite again is a role play game called Avalon at. The participant can vary from 5 to 10. To simplify the rule I will use the setting of five player to introduce.

The character include a blue team leader, Blue team deputy and a civilian. So remaining two are in the Red team which is the evil team character include a red team leader. Anna assassin. So in the beginning, everyone will close their eyes. Then two members from Evil Team will open their eyes for 10 seconds to recognize each other. After that, Blue team leaders will open their eyes and the Red Team member will raise their hand. So it's Blue Team leader will know their identity. Finally, the Blue Team leader, sorry Blue Team deputy will open their eyes. In the meantime, both team leader would raise their hand. Basically the priority of. The Blue Team leader is to identify who is a good leader in the game later. So after this part is done, each character will persist certain level of information and need to guess other players identity by taking several runs of missions missions. So what is the mission will basically file. Player would vote to determine a small group of two to three people to conduct the mission. Each Member will then go within. Each Member will be given two cars to determine if they want the mission. To be successful or failed, the good team member thinks their goods. They can only vote to have the mission successful. But the evil team can either hide their identity by playing the successful car, or they can fail the mission by simply playing the failed card.

Basil being the optimal and traditional ingredient to make pesto, however. There are substitutions that can be made when you think of pesto. The basic elements of a pesto are eh green, in this case, basil, eh nut, normally pine nuts, olive oil and parmesan cheese. If you are do not like basil or you think the taste is too strong, another optimal crop to harvest at the end of the summer is arugula, which can be used in your pesto.

"One of the more difficult concepts to grasp in the container shipping business is fraud or free routine on board. And it can be very difficult to grasp what it's talking about. For instance, let's say you're shipping from India to Canada. And your shipping is. A bushel of bananas. It can feel strange at first that you have to account for. United States customs, you're going from one country to another, and it's not the United States. But what you have to understand is. These ships, these vessels. Docket 1,000,000 different places along the way, right. It's gonna stop in Mexico. It's going to stop in the United States. It's going to stop in, you know, maybe Brazil, Panama. And all of these countries. Have your goods parked at their duck, even if it's only for a couple of hours while they unload somebody elses stuff and load somebody else is on there. And the United States or Panama or wherever you're at is going to want to take into account that time that your product was maybe not on their shores, but. On their docs, on their land, in their water. So we see that a lot when, as I said, when it's moving to Canada, oftentimes the vessel will stop off at Oakland or Tacoma before it moves on to Canada. And in that case the customers customs broker will have to file what's called a frog or an FROB with the United States customs in order to account for the time it's pence in American waters.",7.0

"What on earth? It didn't start in time. I'm going to spend the next two minutes teaching you about the best play in the best sport on Earth. Now, typically in football, everyone has predetermined roles. The quarterback is going to throw it to the wide receiver or hand it to the running back. Running, play, passing, play me. The running backs going left, they're going right. All that is predetermined. But in the option play, the quarterback has the ability to change it mid play. So for instance if it's an option to the right. The quarterback will stare down the defensive end. And if that defensive end is coming to tackle him the quarterback? He'll simply handed to the running back if he's going for the running back. He'll keep it himself. Turn around the corner. There's another guy to read. The other running back is right behind the quarterback. He then has the option to go left and try and break that tackle or draw him left, take the tackle and pitch it out to the running back behind him. So as you can see, everything is predetermined. But. As the play develops. You can change it along the way to be in your best position. This is why it is the best playing football, because even if the defense has the right personnel in and the right play called called. You can just change it halfway through. And for this reason, the last two minutes have told you. The option play, specifically the double option or triple option is. It's called sometimes. Is by far. The best play in football.

This is how I make them to avoid the explosions, which mean they're messy and there's nothing left to eat. I invested in an air fryer which is basically a small oven. It makes it quicker, easier, and cheaper to make. But you can also make them in a general Evan you cut my ex, I shape on the convex side, the one that bulges outward by resting the flat side on a safe service. This allows the chest next to expand when heated app so they don't explode. Soak them in a bowl of warm water for about 15 to 20 minutes. This not only softens them, but any that float to the surface can be binned as they're bad. Dry them after 15 to 20 minutes and placed them in your oven tray or the air fryer with the X facing upwards. I cooked them at around 200 degrees centigrade for 10 to 15 minutes, shaking them halfway through. He may want to take a little bit longer in a general Evan. When the X shape starts to peel back and expose the flesh of the chestnut, they're ready. A tip is to tip them into a tea towel or kitchen towel and shake them. It lets them steam for a couple of minutes and helped shells lift away when you peel them. Then tip them into a bowl. And watch your bones when you're peeling. And definitely don't share them.

We're moving less or more stressed than ever before. Our community is. Are further and further disconnected. This is not how our ancestors lived. And our ancestors were able to thrive and procreate. Much, much, much more seamlessly. As a result. So what the heck do we do about this? Well, we can take some inspiration from our ancestors and realign our biology with our environment. Teach our bodies that it's a safe and stable environment within which to conceive, which means getting nutrient dense food, moving regularly, being in nourishing relationships, and sleeping well. All of the basics. It doesn't have to be so complicated. And when we align our biology within our environment, I imagine we're going to start to see a rebalancing of hormones or rebalancing of our fertility and hopefully a healthier planet.",9.0
"Did you know this fun fact? That in 500 BC. 40% of land was owned by women. I just learned this. What's your reaction to that? Is that more? If so, put your thumbs up or less? If so, put your thumbs down then you would have expected. For my part, it's way more than I would have expected. I imagine the population back then as it is now, is roughly 5050. So if you think about that, that means that most women. Owned land, which is kind of a wild idea. Maybe not so wild. But in 500 BC? It's an interesting thing to think about. So again, 40% of women owned land in 500 BC. I wonder what that percentage is today? Do you think it's more? Or less. Think about that.",8.0
"Did you know that fertility is about more than your hormones? In fact, Fertility is an extension of your overall health, and by our estimation, hormones are only about 30% of the equation. By measuring blood status, immune status, metabolic status and nutrient status in addition to hormone status, you get the full equation. And you get to look at your overall health, rather than just your hormones.",9.0

By measuring your whole health, we get a much better picture of what you're working with, and we can identify any red flags or yellow flags that can interfere with your ability to get pregnant and have a healthy baby. Hormones or one piece of the puzzle. But they're only about 30% of the equation, and we want to measure the whole thing. And that's what pregnancy baldness does.",8.0
"How many of you in the audience? No. Someone. That has struggled to conceive. It could be you. I see a lot of people nodding their heads. That's been my experience as well. As a clinician, I worked with hundreds of folks that were struggling to conceive. And I knew there had to be a better way to approach this problem. That's why I found it poplin, the first pre pregnancy Wellness platform for couples. We offer pre pregnancy Wellness testing for individuals before they start trying. We measure 70 different biomarkers across five different categories of health. Because guess what? Fertility as an extension of your overall health. It's not just about your hormones and by measuring blood status. And immune status. Metabolic status and nutrient status, in addition to hormone status, we get a much better picture of what you're working with. And when we understand your pre pregnancy Wellness baseline, we can identify any red or yellow flags with your ability to get pregnant and have a healthy baby. And then? We can intervene to optimize your chances. Doesn't that sound like a better way? We think so, too.",
"Get. Over. Yourself. It was one of the first things that we learned in this course, and I have never realized the wisdom of those words as much as I have in the last 10 weeks. As someone who's recently written a book, pages and pages and pages of content, I have focused intensely. On honing my message. And yet. I've realized that the delivery of my message is as important, if not more important, in being able to share all of the things that I want to share with the world.

"My perfect Thanksgiving starts bright and early in the morning. A fresh, warm drink followed by a beautiful walk outside to clear your mind. And then. You begin the prep. The prep is so overwhelming you must, must, must include others in the work. Everybody always wants to do it by themselves. That never works. Even if you prep all week. Trying to create the perfect Thanksgiving meal by your lonesome is very lonesome, but also is very draining. And by the time it's meant to be enjoyed, you're too tired to engage in meaningful conversation with your family and friends. So make sure that you are including everybody along on the preparation journey. Get your husband, get your kids. Get your relatives and your friends and your mom and your. Neighbor to help you out in the preparation of all of those delicious ingredients. What's on the table? Obviously the Turkey, except for vegetarians. Last year we ended up making two ingredients, the Turkey and a tofurkey. Then, moving onto the starchy sides, I'd like to do a combination of two things. My mother-in-law always brings a sweet potato casserole with mushrooms outside with marshmallows and brown sugar topping, and I like to do roasted Rosemary potato wedges plus and Israeli couscous topped with caramelized onions. And then onto the fresh vegetables, there was a combination of those as well. There is the fresh raw ingredients that you traditionally served, like a salad or crudites. And then there's the roasted. Now the roasted are very, very flavorful, but the fresh ones really compliment the meal and give it that uplifting flavor profile. Don't forget to save room for dessert. That's the most important meal of it part.",6.0
"I'm going to ask you to close your eyes and imagine with me. A world in which you no longer do your regular grocery shopping in a store. Close your eyes.

Are you going to spend time with your family and friends? Now open your eyes. You've just imagined 2 to 4 extra hours that you get to leverage each week, because you are not, I repeat, are not physically going into the store to complete your shopping. Now, what does that mean for us as a manufacturer? We have to be creative. We have to be collaborative. We have to use our imagination to convince our shoppers to buy our products online, have them delivered to their home in a non invasive way by prompting them to make us as their preferred choice. We will no longer have end caps to build our displays on or floor displays or entry displays. We're going to have to be very creative and how he captured our consumers attention without being with them on location. Let's explore new digital assets and new techniques we could leverage. I'm going to bring it three that I think are important for us to focus on. One is the 8 plus content we need to have. People need beautiful imagery to pick from. 2. They need to be compelling.

Now that's the three hours that we gain by not going and doing our shopping online in store and instead doing our shopping online. My question to you is. How can we make that work?

"I may not look like it. But I mean that may not sound like it. But let me tell you, I'm angry. And I'm sad and I'm frustrated. And nearly every day for the last six years, I've wanted to cry as my children go through the new education norms and learning how to read. How I feel does not necessarily show on the outside, but as a constant anxiety riddled rollercoaster that runs through my mind whenever I see any one of my three children attempting to tackle their schoolwork. Yes, I will admit I will be the first to admit that I'm not an education expert. But I will also be the first to admit that I am angry that our district has not changed their teaching norms and how they educate our children to learn to read. Learning to read is not unnaturally developed skill. Learning to speak and understanding spoken language is a naturally occurring progress in childhood growth. We grow up learning what the words are and how people speak to us and how to use those words. That's a naturally occurring event. Learning how to read is not, and yet our school system is attempting to treat it that way, and all three of my children have gravely been mistreated in trying to learn reading that way. It does not work, and it hasn't worked, and the science has been proven not to work. And yet still our administration and our district and our town does not change. What do I need to do to be heard? I don't want to yell, I don't wanna be mad, I don't want to cry. But it is not working and I need you to stand up with me and fight this for our children.",8.0

"My greatest take away from the last 10 weeks of working with you all is the foundational understanding that there is a big difference between being engaging when you're speaking in small groups. And being engaging with an audience and being engaging with the information that you're sharing to the audience. There is a very big difference between boring numbers that some people like and exciting pieces of information that people can visualize and then internalize based on how you present the information. Having a fun voice or fun face or fun hand gestures can be distracting. Having consistent information that you can present in a meaningful and clear way is very important to your audience, and doing so without a lot of this is also critically important.",8.0

I work on high speed generators, so they're supported at one end on a aircraft gearbox and then just free on the other. So there's a simple equation for the stiffness. And you could. Even though we put it on a shaker and do all this fancy measurements and testing with. Hundreds of $1000 worth of equipment. You can just ballpark the natural frequency. With a simple hand calculation. OK so. That tells you if you're in the right area. Of what your sensors are telling you. They always gotta make the connection.",5.0
"Recently we had to. Conduct a development vibration test, development vibration test on a high speed generator while it was operating and we had. Very small amount of time to do that in.

To rotate the high speed generator so that there are running it over 20,000 RPM with a small amount of electrical load on them when we shake. So it's a physical shaker. It vibrates up and down, side to side. Ah. But we had a very limited time. To get the test done. We had excellent test specialists and excellent support. From the electrical side. To make this happen, we got. What could have taken? We cannot have two weeks. We got done in three days and it was, uh, just magnificent teamwork.

So that as we progress. Along the ear. We have we're gaining points for each activity we take. So basically there is an issue razor every time we find a procedure. Without coverage by Playbook, there's someone raising the issue. The second person that goes there and resolves. The issue resolver gets points the 1st as well and the third one the early adopted the first person that verifies that the playbook is complete. Gets point as well. So we gamify that the second strategy is about communication. We sit your Lambda on the topic of. Discussing the progress as we go into our internal social media so that we get additional coverage and support from our stakeholders. The third topic which is also very important in order to increase repeatability of our process, we have someone highly technical like Rodrigo and it's teaching us how to become fluent API usage.

And I'm sure you remember all of them in the office. That's my secret plan I would like to share with you today is I want to give a voice also to the silent designers, because the silent designers are the ones delivering the project there, diving deep insight into topics and they're doing so good work.

Not I'm not waiting for them to ask for it because I know it's not part of that evening, but I'm so happy for the great work they do so. I bring them there.

My more outgoing people. That you see and also here hanging out on the coffee machine for damage. Important also to be appreciated and seen if all these crazy ideas they have.

I know, even if you're not absolutely familiar with woodwork, tried to put them together. And after Paul has set up the framework, you you'll fix the drawers to fit them in a glass. Work is important. We don't want it to break at all, so I'm going to take care of that. And of course I will oversee everything and the tools. First, we grouped according to the lakes or the drawers. I want everyone to have a good time, and I'm also going to repeat the timer reminding you of all this. So let's get going and have fun. Any questions?",6.0

This will be done with meanings with all staff members and they'll be a few more focused sessions with different heads of departments. Our goal is to ultimately have consistent on brand and vibrant messaging across all platforms, reaching our current audience and hopefully expanding to a new audience of potential customers. After the first few months of calibration, will start preparing for the Connected Learning Summit. Pushing blog posts, social posts and interviews with our various speakers to feature them will be on hand to help with the summit, and then we'll pivot to the annual report. This is a chance for us to show off our achievements in the prior year and to really speak to what we're good at, so that our future partners can really get a quick and fast overview of who we are and what we do. Finally, we close the year with our Givingtuesday campaign, which is the short form campaign primarily on our website to draw people in, get engaged with her message and hopefully donate if they feel inclined. Throughout this process will have posting, blogging and interview opportunities as well as short term marketing campaigns which will allow all of us to flex our creative muscle and work together.

"As manager, I believe in granting challenges to my reports with empathy provided, as well expanding horizons without causing overbearing stress. By granting my team members new challenges, I allow them to control their work life, engaged with their creative ideas, and learn and grow even as they say in their current role. With empathy, I check in from time to time and allow for an open dialogue to happen between us, with feedback and recognition shared on a weekly basis while there is a reporting structure in place with folks. Having their own managers, I keep the door open to me at all times. We can stay grounded and centered on one goal, emphasize the team members strengths and nejm gently towards further success with checking conversations. If we can communicate openly, share our worries, recognize each other's greatness, and work towards the same goal with the same mission in mind, any challenge can be tackled.",7.0

There are four of us and in their four legs, drawers in a decorative decorative glass top. So let's get the drawers assembled first. Nancy, Isaac, you 2 can pass us the drawers as Jake and I assembled them into the right place. Once that is complete, Jake must lift up the jurors together so Nancy and I zic, you too can screw in the legs. And finally, Nancy and Isaac can secure the glass top, if that's OK with you.

"Hi Mimi, I'm afraid I need to have a difficult conversation with you regarding Jake. Is this good time? Great. You know that Jacob has had some difficulty getting up to speed with their performance goals and staying on track. Well, a few months ago Megan and I took some time to meet with Jake, as you know, and we came up with a performance improvement plan with weekly people team Checkins. At the time, Jake was very receptive to this and took full responsibility for his recent issues in his role. We had faith that he would be able to overcome these challenges too, and at first they went quite well and Jake attended weekly meetings. Communicate any issues he had encountered and just let us know when. Things weren't going well, so we were able to help him take charge and get his tasks done. Well, it's been three months and unfortunately we are back to where we started. I've communicated with Jake directly, expressing that this is starting to become a problem again, and Jake was unfortunately less receptive and quite defensive this time around. Megan also spoke with him and encountered a similar attitude from him with regret as I I'm sure you're aware, I'm afraid it's time to let Jake go and for search.

In lieu of that, having a defined plan with goals has been challenging because there's nothing to align it to. Never. Some things that we that the team will be working towards. I will be building out the team to add one additional person in our staffing organization to help consolidate staffing and to hopefully help with response times because each every 2 sellers will have a dedicated staffing person to handle all of their events. I will be adding to our production team to have coverage in both the USA MEA and APAC and their sole focus will be on making sure that the hikes. Experience is great for our clients. I will also be expanding our operations team. I am working currently on that job description. For an operation specialist who will focus on training the team on new processes.

And will support on developing each of those processes, so identifying the areas of improvement and coming up with solutions on how to fix them cross functionally. For our staffing team. The goals will be measured by response times, how long it takes from request through to. Actual completion of the requested task. Another focus for the team in.

"My management philosophy is likely not popular in corporate America. I believe in leading with empathy while also being radically candid. I believe in building relationships that are based on trust and respect and putting the person first. I lead through asking questions and understanding what the core issues are. Collecting input from the team and then making thoughtful decisions based on that that input in the information that's been collected. In the spirit of Scrum, I believe in being a servant leader. How can I help you and lead through helping you? I believe in leading by example. I should not ask my team to do anything that I am not willing to do myself, and I believe in empowering the team.

It requires adherence to process, very good problem solving skills and innovative thinking. We need to build out the team with one additional person so that we can bring all of staffing back under operations and get very efficient and streamlined with our processes so that everyone is operating the same and we reduce the number of problems and conflicts. Production is critical to the success of the hikes. To support the coach on our summit and base camp or Summit and benchmark sessions, we need an additional resource. They're in a pack to service our EMEA mornings and our APAC days. In conjunction with our Americas resource and we need to add an operation specialist to help assist with training the team on the new processes and working through streamlining each of our processes that we have and creating.

"I need to have an important conversation with you doing a few minutes now. Great. I want to discuss some continuing performance issues with Sally. I know you're a big fan of hers, but her performance has become an issue and is dragging the team down and putting us in danger of not meeting goals. We had similar issues before. We worked with her on an improvement plan. It got better for a couple of weeks, but it's back to where it was before the plan. We have expectations that all P1 tasks that are due. Each day or completed, she's not meeting this quota. We also expect all team members to listen to other team members when there's conflict and try to come to a resolution before escalating. I'm hearing she's very combative with her peers, not willing to compromise, and instead of escalating is just ignoring the problem I'm hearing. She's difficult to work with. We have a Nestle of 48 hours for requests, but it's often taking her a week or more to complete them, with no visible justification as to why it's taking that long. This is currently making us short of meeting our KPIs for the quarter, which will affect the rest of the team's compensation. I know that you and she er close. However, at this point I think we've exhausted our options. We've had multiple conversations with her, worked with her on an improvement plan, given her multiple warnings, but it's not getting better. It's significantly affecting the team at this point. It's time to let her go. What concerns do you have with this decision? I understand your concerns. My point of view is we can't stay in a position where one team member is bringing the rest of the organization down.

"Hey, did you know 40% of women owned land in 500 BC? Shocked me too. The reason was that to add to their independence, this would allow them to own land and manage their own properties. By this they received a legal status that was equal to men. This wasn't a huge contrast compared to the Romans, where women were always dependent on the men and their families to help them manage the property. They didn't have enough rights. They weren't you treated equal, but Sparta had very different they were, they were. It involved in agriculture, they enjoyed other rights and they were equally extraordinary. That's a fun fact.

"Hi everyone. One of the issues that I think we need to pay attention to the world needs to pay attention to one of the biggest ones. So I'm not saying that's the only one, but one of the biggest ones is our education. Um, it's very unfortunate that one of the biggest issues is government funding. Our schools do not receive the accurate government funding or funding period, to enable kids. Less funding means smaller to staff, less teachers, more students. Fewer programs. A lot of schools don't offer all the programs that students should. Beginning to get better. Better education. And then of course they don't have enough resources because there's no funding. They don't have the advanced technologies that some of these higher funding schools get, or the private schools or charter schools. So it's very unfortunate and it impacts negatively to the kids going to these schools because they don't have all the great resources, um, even though they have the potential. So that is one of the biggest of issues when it comes to education. The other issue is the education. The second one I guess would be the safety, the safety of kids in our school. I mean considering all the issues have been going on recently, recent years, even in the past, this is nothing new. About school safety should be one of our top concerns. Not sure what's the best way, but maybe armguard schools should be unlocked. Should be locked as soon as that first morning Bell goes off um, and the only time it should the gates should ever open should be when they get dismissed. Someone should sign off the kids in middle school, high school, and of course clear backpacks, metal detectors so they only bring. Books and equipment or anything that they need in order to attend their class. Um, these kids have suffered through a lot with all these closures. So let's get them back in school and make this country strong, because students are the future of the country. Thank you.",5.0
"Hey everyone. Alright, so today we're going to talk about how to cook chicken Curry Indian style. Um, if you've had it and if you like it, you're gonna love this 'cause it's easy, easy recipe. The only thing that takes a little bit longer as a prep time so you get the amount of chicken you want and to get it more flavorful, ideally you should marinate it first. And it's pretty straightforward, meaning you get a spoon of yogurt menu chicken at least for a few hours overnight. Would be the best option, but if you don't have that, just few hours would be great and add some sprinkle, some salt, some red chili powder, cumin and. Um, lemon. Um. close it, cover it and just put it aside for a few hours if that's the plan. If not overnight. And then we put it aside. Then we moved her stuff. Now here what we need is a pressure cooker. Again, that's perfect, but if you don't have a pressure cooker, this can also be made in a deep frying pan. You add teaspoon of oil at some garlic and some onions. You keep stirring. It keeps doing it until the onions start to get a little bit more clearly. Carmalized, but just kind of start looking transparent. Then you add 2 meric powder, like half a teaspoon, half a teaspoon of um. Rachel Powder, and then two Bay leaves and one cinnamon. And then you keep mixing it just for a few more minutes, just few minutes until it looks like everything kind of blended together. Next it would be we take that chicken. If you put in the fridge, you take out the fridge, but in the pressure cooker. Now you'd start mixing it, mixing it. You want to do that news for a good 15 minutes. Just make sure you stick. Chicken doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan, so you kind of have to keep stirring it. So the spice is going to get blended in together. And then you add tomato, one tomato, cut it up. Are you on it? And then um, half a cup of water? You can have more water 'cause it just depends on how much Curry you want. And then you add salt and more red chili powder and chicken masala if you have it. If not, that's not really needed it, mix it up. Is that everything looks good. You don't need anymore water. You close the lid of the pressure cooker. Now if you're doing in pressure cooker, you let it go for two whistles. If you're cooking in a pan, just put the lid on and then keep stirring it in until you like the consistency and the chicken looks like it's just falling off your fork. Whatever you try to stop, cut it with.",6.0
"Hello everyone, my name is Pooja Sharma stuff and I'm going to talk about the reporting and automation and how do we, how do we use lean at at work and make it a standard or. So basically the way the project works or the way the whole process happens is we take requirements from the user. So there's like a requirement gathering phase. Then review with that steak that requirement with the stakeholders, understand the priorities and weigh it with the rest of the priorities that we have and kind of figure out which one is a party for them. Like based on their benefits story, what is the key features they're looking for, what can be delivered and is that more tailored to just a person organization or is that a standard? Process that can be used across the border crosser from organizations. So the goal shouldn't just be written to digitize the process.

How do we automate the data, right, like there's multiple different places, so instead of having to go fetch it from different data sources, how do we bring it all together? Is there one place to go review this information? And drive standard, right, like how do we try standard when it comes to like sales and optimizing our processes and just be in general like operation stability? So we need to build export solutions that breaks these cells and brings the teams together and, you know, minimize competing.

"Alright Patrick, so today I am going to teach you how to make lasagna soup. I recently tried this as a comfort food and provided it to someone who recently lost a family member. So I've made it a couple of times in the past couple weeks and I am just in love with it. You start by getting all your groceries together, right? So you go get sausage, noodles, all of your seasonings. Garlic bread if you want it. The most important thing I find though is the Yum that goes on top. So that would be the ricotta cheese and the Parmesan. You mix them together and you put it on top of the suit. So that might be my favorite thing that's involved with this soup. So you need the noodles, the ricotta Parmesan, the seasonings and the sausage, and that's really all you need. Most of the seasonings you probably already have in your cabinet at home, so it's pretty. It's pretty basic and you also need tomato paste and fire roasted tomatoes to throw in the pot. So the. The directions ultimately say to brown your sausage, put all the ingredients in and take it off the stove. My thought is you put all the ingredients in and you let it simmer for the entire day and it really gathers all the flavors. So you start by breaking up your sausage. So you fry your sausage, you break it up, you cook it a little bit, you let it simmer for a minute, and then you start throwing in your seasoning. So you're going to use a little bit of garlic, minced garlic. You're going to use a little bit of red pepper flakes. I measure with my heart. You measure how you want. I just use what I think I want like the most. I really like garlic. I really like a little bit of spice, so I use a little bit of extra red pepper flakes. I'd say about a tablespoon and 1/2 is probably what I use. Salt and pepper and then the tomatoes, the fire roasted tomatoes, that actually. Provides a lot more seasoning for the mixture, if you will, because it's got so many spices already in it, you don't have to add a lot more. I do add a little bit more garlic salt just because I do like garlic and. I I don't know. I just really enjoy garlic. So I just put extra in there and I get, I measure with my heart. So you put all the ingredients into in a little bit of onion. I almost forgot the onion, cannot forget the onion that also tastes delicious with the soup. So you put it all into your skillet. You kind of just start throwing stuff in. That's how I do it. I'ma cooker who just kind of measures with their heart and just throws it in there. As long as all the ingredients are in, I feel like it works well for me, the onions, because I don't just take it directly.",6.0

After you go into action, you then choose from one of the topics that you would like to complete. So it could be a compensation change, it could be a job change, it could be a schedule change.

Pay change all of this in one transaction so to do that. I am going to show you. On here how to do it. So you go into actions and you choose job change once you choose that. It will give you. Different sections to fill in, the first one being your effective date. Make sure that you have your effective date correct. It's a big deal. It's what the system goes off of, its how everything else flows, so everything will be affective that date. Then you continue to fill out the information. Once you are done, that is where the pay change will then populate, so the compensation change comes after. The job change.

But on the other hand, think about, you know, global custody. It's not really the appealing employer, of course, being why it's a bank, but it's very conservative. It's. The perception of people is that. No, it's boring. There is nothing exciting there. There are no real benefits besides, let's say, pay to work at an employer like us.

"Minute Teach is going to be on like the fundamentals of kickboxing. It's something that I've done for about a year now. It's something that I've become quite passionate about. So very first thing that you need to know is your stunts. So instead of being straight on, you want to be slightly side on. You don't want to be facing too far that way, otherwise you're not going to be able to for any punches. You don't want to be straight on over hires. You're going to be in a lot of shots, so you want to angle slightly that way. And then want to keep your face directly towards your opponent and try and talk your chin slightly into your shoulder. Because that way anytime any shots are coming towards you can move that way you can move that way you can move backwards a bit easier and that shoulders going to cover your chin, you want to keep one hand quite far out and this hand took to your chin to protect, um this side of your face. So you sort of got two different barriers whichever way you go in with your shoulder and we've you raise hand. And these three basic punches for you start off learning is first a job, which is with your lead hunt, which is a bit further out and you can be able to twist and then come back, but as you punch in, you still want to keep your chin tucked to that shoulder. And then the second one, but you want to learn is across, which is the exact same punch except with your right hand. So as you're going in, protect it with this shoulder this time and keep this hand a bit further back so it's sort of complete opposites one goes out. One comes back in and always protected with you over shoulder, and the third most basic punch, but you learn would be a hook which is going to be using your front hand. Instead of going straight on and twisting it around, you bring it around the outside. It's a sort of loop around their front hand as well and that's pretty much the basics of kickboxing that I've learned.",5.0
"90 minutes talk is on my experience with GE so far. I've been in the company since February now when I first joined, I got a lovely picture of myself where I definitely needed a haircut. I was hired to be a design engineer working on the Dasso project that we've currently got going. This is for a commercial plan for a French company DASSO plans. I'm working on the 10X project as a design engineer. I've come in and on the design standard 2. This is what we're going to be using for qualification and when we do our qualification it goes throughout all the design process and then testing as well. When I've joined I've been working a lot on plastics and a lot on stat posts, so it's going to be doing tolerance stacking, redesigns and then moving on to finally doing different drawings. We're doing a lot of the drawings at the minute to be able to hand them over to the customer and hand them over to the suppliers so we can find out whether they can actually make them, if there's anything that we need to change. Some problems that we've had on the going is definitely with the timescales. It's very, very, very compact. The amount of what we have to do in such a short space of time and due to this workload is being pretty high and a lot of stuff has had to be in rushed. So there are a few errors that sometimes creep through to try and eradicate this. Recently we've got some consultants to come in that I've been able to help us and they do a lot of the drawings and help us sort of graph through all those really laborious sort of tasks.",5.0

If you ever did it, connect the dot as a child, the whole purpose was there would be dots on a piece of paper and you would connect them. With a pencil. Think of those that pencil as fight planning.

Today I'm going to teach you a little bit about flight planning. So if I'm going from Denver to Atlanta, think about it as a connect the dots. Did any of you ever do connect the dots as a young child and you had a piece of paper with dots on it and the key was to connect them to make a picture. Well, that's kind of what flight planning does. It says I'm going from Denver to Atlanta and this is the dot path. I'm going to get there. We work with other functions such as vertical and lateral to figure out high how high we already placed in our little line. To figure out in my kind of turning to get to the next path or am I going straight so flight planning is behind how I'm going to get there? And then? There's many planes going from one place to the other that happened to be the same. Or maybe I'm going from this airport? Up here over there my path might look. A lot different.

"One thing that I think the world needs to work on more as renewable energy. But we can't just focus on. All renewable energy it needs to be a balance. There's a lot of push towards electric cars and those are a great option, but also. We can't just use electric cars without thinking about what else is out there. So a lot of places. A lot of remote areas are using. A diesel. Generator to power your electric cars. So. That doesn't really work because. It takes a lot more diesel gas to run the generator to charge your electric car in the city. When you can plug it in every night it is very good. Works great, but. When you're trying to use all of this diesel. For a couple 100 miles, you actually end up spending more of the gas and creating more of the pollution than you would if it was just a gas car, so.

"Recently I've been working on a lot of ants simulations. So the basics of starting an ANSYS simulation is getting the base bones in. Annex and to do this you're going to want to make sure that you build a sheet model. The reason you do is sheet model is because. Later on you can change the thickness of the sheets, which makes comparing designs a lot easier in ANSYS. So once you have your sheet model, you can start to. Mesh in either ants in ANSYS or in an axe if you bring. Umesh over in an X, it's going to be a little bit more complicated, but you're not going to have to do that in ANSYS now. Once you get your mesh in ANSYS, you're going to 1st. Make sure that you. Assign a material. You're going to want to make sure all of your meshes are correct. And then you're going to want to apply your forces. Now the forces and the fixed constraints are very, very important. You have to get these right, or it might not really act the way you want it to. So. Just try one out. Hit run on ANSYS and see how it works. OK, it's popped up now. It doesn't look the way you want it. Maybe try a different constraint. And.

And other non fixed constraints so that your model holds the way it would in the real world. After that, it's just a matter of hitting Ron and you'll start to get results if your results don't really look the way you want. You can always try to. Rerun with different constraints.

And buy them succeeding, they will be able to make the planet more sustainable and make it better for all people, not just themselves. School gives great schooled also gives students a great opportunity for social lives and building strong friendships for the rest of their lives. And by this they're in rooms with people their age where they're forced to talk to each other, work on projects and for them. It brings down that barrier and it helps build those social skills in those social environments, which is a key tool in the real world. And then without bettering schools, I think. If the schools are the same or worse than. What they are now, I think society will have plateaued or start to digress. The people working in these current jobs will go to retirement and then the younger kids will go to take over their jobs. And by this I think the kids or young adults at that time will be set up for failure because they will not have the skills needed to be in some technical jobs. They won't have the so they won't have as many social skills to interact with each other in a work environment.

"Hi So what I'm going to teach you today is how to make a 3D printed part. The first thing that you need to do is determine what type of 3D printer you have. Some people use resin printers you some people may even have metal printers. What we use today, what I'm using is a plastic filament extruder printer. First thing that we need to do is make our own model. So what that what you can do. You can create your own model where you. Go in and you can design whatever you want and a software program like AutoCAD or SolidWorks. What I normally do is I actually go online and open source where um models already created. So I go down, pick out a file on that open source and so once I have that model we put it into a slicer program. But uh, Slicer program does is that makes the part into the. Software needed for the 3D printer so just slices every layer of that 3D printer and how the how the plastics going to print out onto the part. Once we do that, you need to prep your printer. So for extruder printer, the first thing we need to make sure is we have enough plastic filament that we're going to use. The next thing we need to do is we need to clean the printer, make sure the base is all nice and clean, no residue from the leftover prints. After that we need to balance the base, so we need to make everything nice and level. We need to make sure that everything is all warmed up because the base it can be. The base needs to be warmed up so the wack so for the plastic to melt on it and then the nozzle also needs to be warmed up as well so it melts out and evenly manner. And then from there you let it run. And then after that once you have your part after so many hours you have to go remove it from the plate and then knock off all the support routes, all the supports on there. And once you do that you'll have a finished product like this.",5.0
"Currently in the aerospace industry, castings are holding up a whole bunch of engines. Ah. And what I want to explain to you is how a foundry is not like most manufacturing and why there are those delays and delinquencies. So in a foundry it is not your typical manufacturing process, it is a batch process. Most places run wanna do that leans single piece flow and in the foundry you cannot. Do that what the equipment that's currently in place? Uh, most of the parts have a lot of hand work done on them and not a lot of automation. And this is because you need a robot can't go in and fix all the part, everything Anna parked. And lastly, it can take weeks if not months to get a part through the entire operation since, eh, there's a man, there's plenty of inspection and there's lots of processes that go into making a single casting. And because of this, this can cause some serious. Issues and too narrow space industry. As well and tour foundry. First off, if to find some, something may happen in your process and I can take a couple weeks to get to that inspection of the part where you realize every single part has an issue caused by something early on in the process and this causes you to have weeks of parts that are either scrapped or have defects in them that would need to be reworked. The next thing is reworks can take weeks to complete. This is because for some parts where you can repair the certain defects or Weld over them, there you go between. The finishing room where people are hand during it to inspection and it goes back and forth. And then lastly the lack of robotics makes it heavily on the person. So there's more likely cause of defects from individuals that's not a robot. And so because of this you could have extended lead times and delinquencies, you have parts not getting on engines and you could have a whole bunch of defects going on at, uh, single foundry at a single time. And that is why it is. Why there are so many issues with boundaries at the moment?",5.0
"Castings are a major issue and aerospace industry right now and the founder is different than most manufacturing. A foundry is typically a batch process and not the lean single piece flow that companies like due to the expensive equipment that already exist. Um a lot of stuff in the foundries done by hands and not by automation. And it can take weeks if not months to get parts from start to finish out of a foundry and this can cause some serious issues. For example, within inspection being at the end, you could have a part at the beginning where you find an operator who's working by hand as causing a defect. So you could have weeks or parts if not months of parts having at the same defect. And then when you get to rework it, reworks can take extra weeks going in between inspection and the finishing room. And because of all this. Casting shipments can be delayed significantly, and This is why castings are one of the parts that are causing delays and assembling engines in the aerospace industry.",

"Last night, taking my son back to college, 11:00 o'clock at night. Driving late, getting him back to school. We start talking about. What else? My son needs a car for college. He's tired of his dad driving him back and forth to school. He says, dad, I think I need an EV. And I said what? A small, tiny, very small electric vehicle for my big tall 6 foot five son of mine. I chuckled. He said again. And Evie, dad, it's time we save the planet. I was proud and a little embarrassed. So proud that my son. 18 years old is focused on trying to save the world. One mile at a time. A little embarrassed to not have been in the same place as him. These kids, I'm going to sound old, but they've grown up with us. It's front and center to them day in, day out. Heat waves, floods, volcanoes, you name it, they've lived it since they've been in existence. It's been the same for others, perhaps more experienced folks, but that gradual gaslight, if you will, is different, I would say for some generations, then for others. Very proud. I have renewed my focus and my energy to try to be a better steward of our planet and certainly my son and his friends and that generation. Um, hopefully they will carry the torch as well. Thank you for the time to talk about the environment. Let's make a change.",6.0
"OK. All right. Hello, my name is Matt. Today I'd like to talk to you about food. My favorite food is a peanut butter and Jelly sandwich. I'm not familiar with this classic sandwich. All that is required are two pieces of bread. And you guessed it, some peanut butter and some Jelly. That is it. Simple ingredients, easy to make. Healthy. Maybe. Delicious, surely. So let's talk about construction. And grab your teeth for slices of your favorite bread. Doesn't matter what kind, but make sure it's your favorite. Lay down a nice coating and peanut butter on one side of each slice. Only one side. Otherwise things may get messy. And let's talk some strategy, some sandwich strategy. Make sure that you cover the entire slice of bread so you don't have any potential Jelly accidents later on. Sometimes on the counter, sometimes on the floor, but the right spot is the peanut butter right in the middle of that slice of bread. Spread that Jelly around again, 100% coverage is your goal. Place the other slice on top. Put that together and now you have perfected the perfect peanut butter and Jelly sandwich. Enjoy. That was really good. I don't think I can match up to that one. How?",6.0
"Good morning. My name is Matt's um err. I've been working at GE for 12 years. Um, in my role at GE Aerospace, I support technical cleanliness. What is that? Well, technical cleanliness is keeping the very small foreign object debris, domestic object debris, hard particles out of the engine. These very small pieces, similar to sand in your bicycle chain, will grind away at our gears, grind away at our bearings, making the engines less efficient and less durable. I'd like to also introduce to you. One of my teammates, Darsin, that joined our team and January 2022, Mr Talaga has a very broad diverse. Background. I was born and raised in the Midwest United States. Darshan was born and raised and fair Lanka. Certainly different sides of the world, different cultures, different upbringings. We were tasked together to build upon our specification, as we all know GT specifications. Boring for the most part, but effective. They serve a purpose. They they need we need the specs, and I guess they need us. So my youth, if you will, um Darshans experience. I'm in my 40s, he's in his 60s. Are cultural backgrounds, are diversity in our cultures and our careers together? We were able to update this specification. It's certainly much better. It's more focused, it's more involved, it's just a better document for our end user and will make our engines safer and more durable. Thank you.",6.0

Foreign object debris, FOD domestic object debris, DoD hard particle contamination, all contaminants that can damage an engine. It can get into the gears, it can get into the bearings. Think about sand in your bicycle chain, that grinding, the grinding as you puddle, but at a larger, faster, more important skill. Once these small pieces get into our engine, they can cause trouble. So we have a team, a global team around the world, to keep our engines clean, to keep them durable, and to keep them flying to get you where you need to be. Thank you.",
"GE Aerospace advances. The state-of-the-art when it comes to flight and making it possible we lift people up and deliver them safely to their destinations were doing it more efficiently with newer materials. That burns less fuel and. Requires less maintenance, allowing our customers to operate more efficiently, and we're advancing the state-of-the-art all the time, both in the military space and the civilian sector. A lot of this advancement comes by hiring the best and brightest people. We get engineers from all over the world. Working with external partners, suppliers. And across company groups to achieve a common goal which is. To fly more efficiently. At a cheaper price and. This also helps to advance society as a whole, a lot of the innovation that happens in aviation, just like with NASA and feeding technology down from. Prepping for space launches to the common person. Advancements we make in our industry also feed down to advancements that get into cars and everyday electronics or. Things that people use everyday, sensors that are made aviation grade become. Top of the line tech that can be used in other industries and so forth. Thank you.",

The one currently happening is probably the only one caused by single species to other species. Biodiversity of both plants and animals. Is declining. And there are many causes for this. Mostly. The fact that we are polluting the planet and putting toxins into the environment that plants and animals cannot. Tolerate. Destruction of habitat. Not only by possibly over logging and mining for resources, but also just. Creating more farmland reduces the diversity of plants in an area. It reduces the biodiversity of insects and animals that feed on those. And then finally, climate change heating planet reduces. Ice in the polar regions it increases desert desert fication of.

This scope is to create a general overview on some components to understand if it's possible or not from a static, dynamic, thermal and etc etc POV. Usually you receive a minimum number of inputs that change frequently, probably day by day, and you have to develop some rapid tools to obtain output in the shortest possible time. The design needs to be regularly updated to underlying problem as soon as possible. In this way, these iterative design implements all new ideas, solution and the inputs at the same time. To obtain a correct preliminary design, it's an accessory. Ah, good communication between different teams and also between the input output iterative phase. If decisions implemented.

So I think that he should be. Promoted as a team lead and finally being able to give more influence over what we do. On the other hand, we have Mariah. She's an excellent expert. I think she's probably the one who knows more about our technical tasks in the team and she's really happy with what she's doing. So why not give her and hold his own tail growth? Ask them which other trainings that she would like to engage and being able to develop her potential. I think that this will be a very, very, very good decision if we can plan this, put that into paper and finally. Execute better than what we are doing now.",
"My boss is a great individual and a really, really good leader who is really respected on the company, specially among his peers. So he's in a difficult situation because he's leading a team of more than 20 people that have a variety of really different functions. So I think that I could really help him by trying to provide expert knowledge and delivering a number of KP eyes that are affecting our processes performance in a way that. We can reflect and he can perceive what is a process that we are doing so step by step improving on a small but a countable number of number of stages. So for this I think I should provide this knowledge and I should be able to deliver it to him in a smart, so in a measurable way, on a structured way so that he can also provide this to his bosses and they perceived progress. This would be the way I could have to unload him of all the daily tasks that he can really delegate.",
"Hello Andrea. How you doing? I think what do you remember that we spoke a while ago? Our Mac. So that was, I think that someone there were like 3. And I think it's time that we have that difficult conversation again. Um, I have really tried. Approaching mark. Having difficult conversations with him we have he tried to achieve a number of minimum goals and improvements, improvement areas where should he should have, except for now. It was very easy for him to commit and then deliver on what he promised. But again he has fallen back. And I'm not saying that he is not working. It's not that he's not doing anything, but he has become somehow toxic by comparison to his peers. I think that we have a very healthy environment. It's not that we're telling jokes all day long, but our team is normally working, training, coaching each other. But he's falling under his just number of topics he feels comfortable with. And not providing the things he's asked to do. So we have put a number of KP eyes in place. So do these five tasks do these three topics and he has not done any of them. And I don't think that this is just an underperforming person, but he's not showing respect to anyone, not only to me as his manager, that's what should be expected, but also to his peers 'cause whatever he's not doing. He's offloading that to the newcomers, so two people he's not. Considering as his peers, he just have people that work for him somehow. And I don't think. That a person like him.

"In the plan for my team, I have want to. Have a very defined goal and that is and that goal is to have a data-driven or the security improvement team. So in order to achieve that goal, I would like to have the following strategies in place. So right now we are using some improvement or some assessment, assessment material and the truth is this is falling short in some situations. So one of the first strategies is we have to improve the assessment material there means reviewing it, validating it with the factories and making sure new versions are developed and used. Also we have to review the assessment process. Right now there is no, it is not really streamlined and one of the field first things we have to do is reduce the amount of work we dedicated to managing the work instead of working. So the assessment process has to be reviewed and as the last step we have to also increase the visibility of the result for the stakeholders. Um, it is very good for the security team to have the results, but also the stakeholders would need to have a KP eyes would need to have some idea of how they work they are doing during this assessment is reflective and how it changes over time. So developing a dashboard or some kind of strategy like that would make would be very beneficial for the team. Now I know in terms of blockers, there are some of them, so the team is completely dispersed. We have people in China, we have people in the in Europe, we have people in the US. And thanks, um, sorry, talent. So we have to figure that one out and see how we can adapt the meetings, the meeting structure to feed those differences. Also language. Sometimes some things are lost in translation and. Maybe in that case it helps to move towards a more visual approach where we use tools like concept board, drawings etc to help us communicate and who helped make sure we are on the same page. Because at the end of the day that is the target we have to move on like like one single team and structured. Restructured everything in a way that doesn't matter who takes a certain problem, we have to have guarantees that it's always handled the same way. In terms of KP eyes for this year or critical size will have to be assessed. And also all Criticals site will hard. We need to have a an action plan and an actual band. It's completely feasible and under our control. The last thing is for the critical size that don't have nobility management, we have to make sure there is a decision to reliably management and when.

So standardization has to be one of the key guiding principles of my management philosophy. Of course quality stylish and helps with quality, but it's not always the same, so. Any output from the team has to be up to a certain standard and we have to make sure there is no. Yeah. That delete deliverables should live up to the expectations and we make our customers in the factory is happy and the last one is excellent. Everything goes together.

We are trying to come up with plans as a team so. We are working on improving that and he's working very hard to improve that. I trust in the following months we will start to see an improvement there and and some substantial improvement. Continuing with Muhammad, Muhammad, the USA. What can I say? He's very, very or he's extremely. Conscious about what he does. So when you request the thing you can make sure Muhammad we will do it as requested. And that is also the other edge of this words. He is not very creative in that regard and has to have instructions, written instructions for everything, I think as part of my management role. And help with that. And it is also my beauty to provide such instructions to make sure things are done as expected. The last one would be Susannah Susanna in the in Germany.

It's not fair to keep him as part of the team while everybody else he's picking up his slack and trying to make up for what he's not doing. I know, Roberto. You wrote it very much for for him.

First step, take this free fingers, grab your string. And slowly. But strongly. Pull it until you get in contact with your face. And remember, you must get in contact with your face. Because these ensure a repeatative and constant shooting, every arrow you'll throw will fly the same. And now, er, homeless, ready to shoot. One more step aiming. So think about the trajectory of your hero. Visualize the connection between the tip of your hero and your target. Visualize that theme but very strong connection that connects the two element target and arrow and now just relax. Let your fingers flow back on your face and leave the arrow. And enjoy the flight.",7.0
"Good afternoon. My name is Marco Banesa and today I'm going to show you and describe you the process of MRB. MRB stands for Material Review Board and as a minimum be engineer. I haven't a task to review and assess the process non conformances and the product nonconformance is. Everything starts with a part not meeting one or more drawing requirement which is submitted to engineering team by the quality or our inspection team. A key part of the process is to have a complete. Field and well detailed description of the nonconformance E which kind of um requirement is impacted and which is the entity of the nonconformance. The second step is the nonconformance being judged by us. So we look into the the detail report we understand. The effect that the defect may have on the part, and we try to answer 4 different questions, does the defect impact form? So is the part different in time of weight, volume, general appearance? 2nd. Is there any impact on functionality? So do we we need to expect something different from this part? We expect to. Ah, good one. Third Point is. To check defeat. Have we able to assemble the part? Can we stick the part into its assembly? Can we press it into the fit? Or is there anything else which is preventing us to properly engage the part with the surrounding material? Four point, is there any impact on serviceability and once you have checked all these material of the points you can say the party is good or apart is bad?",6.0

"So today I'm going to teach you how to repot a plant. So during COVID I got really into house plants and soon enough they did really well and they needed to be repotted from their nursery pots. So a couple of things you'll need. You'll need a bigger pot, I like to get ones with draining holes and you'll need a good soil water I like to use like a trash bag just to lay down on the surface to keep it clean and. Gardening gloves. So first what you'll do is you'll take your plants that needs to be repotted and you'll kind of loosen up by pinching around the base and then you'll be able to wiggle off the pot. And then what I like to do is to kind of shake the plant a little and get all that excess dirt off the roots. Next I'll prep my new pot by adding some new soil, and I kind of make like a whole around where it would be big enough to put the new plant inside. So once you have the whole dugout, I carefully put the plan in and then shake some more soil around until all the roots are covered. Next I'll add some water around just to make sure it's wet, and then lastly I'll dust off the Leafs to make sure that there's no extra soil on the leaves just so they can get all the light they need. And that is my two-minute teach. But it was only like a minute 40 or so.",5.0

They don't know the word structure and they just haven't had all the experience that maybe when I went to high school and had that support, or maybe even the support of their parents at home, that they are lacking those basic skills.

Well, when they landed vertically. As they have now. This is when you see oil come out of this week home. Now. Technically for the oil to stay in the system. The holes would have to be.

People needs a different support. I have rock stars, I have sold players and I have people who really work hard and that's why I really appreciate it. Give me some kind of space to motivate those who needs that motivation. I would like to uh to members of my team. I need to be very careful with handling with them, which means that. They're superstars, but in there alone and very comfort zone. I cannot push them into the new tasks. They were they were completely they were completely fine in a comfort zone and they deliver even higher than it is expected. They need to be left alone but checked in the meantime. What I am trying to do and a very short conversation, eh just. Remember not to push them a lot, but at the same time discuss with them. And there are also the different part of my team, people who are really rock stars. I should not really be afraid that they will not deliver, but in the meantime they did a lot of things in between. That's why sometimes I need to pick them up and just to try to define. What are the priorities for now? Because they have plenty of priorities and then sometimes they forget to focus on the right one. That's why I need you to support me in that journey.",

"So good to see you. And fun fact, I just realized before meeting you today that we are actually two very different people. I'm the more outgoing like we're talking song stop me if it's too much for you. And I know that you're a little bit more this silent person. And interestingly my team, I have the same challenge. I have this two peer groups, let's call these types of designers. There's the silent designer. And there's this outgoing, shiny designer, always talkative, and this is the person you will see. And I'm sure you remember all of them in the office. That's my secret plan I would like to share with you today is I want to give a voice also to the silent designers, because the silent designers are the ones delivering the project there, diving deep insight into topics and they're doing so good work. So my plan is to give them also some recognition. And I see my. My goal to give them reward by giving them also rise of salary. Not I'm not waiting for them to ask for it because I know it's not part of that evening, but I'm so happy for the great work they do so. I bring them there. And what I would love for my team is this kind of partly more quiet space, because I noticed more silent people. They need space to think and any silence to think. On the other hand. My more outgoing people. That you see and also here hanging out on the coffee machine for damage. Important also to be appreciated and seen if all these crazy ideas they have. So they want to be very much involved. So it would be great also for you once in awhile ago and ask them for their ideas and to involve them and ship them to bring the company to the next level.",

For doing this great job she's doing. One part of her job is to let us go and let us grow. So she's giving us the space to evolve and to do our Trump ourselves, not taking everything from us and doing it herself. So she's there. Very outgoing and leaving us out and giving us space. On the other hand, she's always this rock or this milestone, having this vision and having always the big fuel ahead what's going to come and she always knows how to navigate us so we can rely on her.",
"Andrea. I'm going to talk to you about a difficult topic. May I? Thanks. So to come directly to the table about it, um, I think you remember that we talked about Stephanie two weeks ago already that we had this struggles in the team and I know that you're having very high. Version of her and that you really appreciate her work and that he was very quietly not for her. And I see that she's very important emm point to you and I also see that you want that you see something inside her. I have the problem that after we went through all this. Yeah, down that she didn't perform. You remember? It is. And then it went up again. So now I have to figure it's getting down again and to be honest and to put it on the table. It's not working on my team like this anymore because I have clients already refusing to work with her. I have problems to start her own projects. And I also see that when I try to convince him to help her to go further, she's completely blocking and I don't feel any energy from her side. But I'm really, really sad about I don't feel the energy that really wants to improve and stay here. So I pointed it out. Also in the last talk that I had with her and asking her letter, she herself feels comfortable and her honest answer was that in the end she's not going to quit. Yep. She's not seeing herself here. She's not feeling comfortable, but she's not going to quit. And if so, we have to do it. So I have this trouble off. But I don't see her inside of my team because there's right now that I tried a lot of all these things that I've known for his coaching. And I think in her site in herself, she already quit. So I need your help. To bring her out of my team to another team or to let go?",6.0
